## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive—but even the best AI development tools can occasionally hit a snag. Sometimes your code won't run as expected, or you might notice unexpected behavior where the AI interprets your intent incorrectly.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate issues and get back on track:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0W8bsbHh2p8?si=p4kWhkdu0PEbgGXm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the Try to Fix Button First">
    Click the **Try to Fix** button when an error shows up. Lovable will scan your logs, detect the issue, and attempt a quick fix. It's your fastest first move. If that doesn't work, it's time to dig deeper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose Unexpected Behavior">
    Your code may run without errors but not behave as intended. That's **unexpected behavior**—harder to spot and harder to fix. Try this:

    - **Review your original prompt** to confirm your instructions.
    - **Break it down**: Check individual components and logic.
    - **Add visuals**: Use screenshots to clarify what went wrong.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write More Effective Prompts">
    Clear, structured prompts lead to better results. Use this format:

    1. **Project Overview** – What are you building?
    2. **Page Structure** – List key pages/components.
    3. **Navigation Logic** – Describe user flow.
    4. **Visual Aids** – Upload wireframes or screenshots.
    5. **Implementation Steps** – Lay out the build order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build in Logical Order">
    Structure matters. Follow this recommended flow:

    1. Create layout and pages.
    2. Connect Supabase or your backend.
    3. Set up authentication and user roles.
    4. Plan and organize feature logic.
    5. Prompt Lovable to implement features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Chat Mode for Clarity">
    When unsure, switch to **Chat Mode**:

    - Ask Lovable to **analyze your project state**.
    - Request a **recap of attempted solutions**.
    - Prompt for **new directions** to solve persistent problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If You're Still Stuck: Advanced Tactics">
    Still no luck? Try this:

    - **Be exact** – Describe the bug and your expectations clearly.
    - **Use images** – Screenshots or videos help illustrate problems.
    - **Ask directly** – "What else can we try?"
    - **Rollback** – Restore to a working version and rebuild incrementally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Going Wrong? Common Troubleshooting Areas

Troubleshooting generally falls into these categories:

1. **UI or Layout Glitches**
2. **API or Backend Issues**
3. **Prompt Misinterpretations**
4. **AI Unresponsiveness or Misbehavior**
5. **Platform or Integration Errors**

Use the accordions below to identify specific issues and actions:

    Branch switching is experimental. Use at your own risk.

    Once connected to GitHub, you can work with different branches:

    #### **Branch Switching Steps**

    ```
    # To switch from main to dev:
    1. In Dev Mode, open the Git panel
    2. Select the branch dropdown
    3. Choose "dev" or click "Create new branch" if it doesn't exist
    4. Your workspace will update to reflect the selected branch
    ```

    <Note>
      Switching branches will change all files in your workspace to match that branch.
    </Note>
    #### **Branch Management:**

    - **Create a new branch:** Click "Create new branch" in the Git panel
    - **Delete a branch:** Use the GitHub interface (not available directly in Lovable)
    - **Default branch:** Set in GitHub repository settings

    If you can't switch branches:

    - Commit or stash any uncommitted changes
    - Check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten
    - Try refreshing the Lovable editor
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repository sync issues">
    - Check your [GitHub permissions](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).
    - Use rollback to undo unwanted changes.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues">
    If you're having trouble with GitHub authentication:

    - Reconnect your GitHub account in Lovable

    If your push is rejected:

    1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
    2. Resolve any conflicts
    3. Try pushing again
    4. If still failing, check if the branch is protected
