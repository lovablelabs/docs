## "Try to Fix" error loops

Building with Lovable makes coding faster and more intuitive—but even the best AI development tools can occasionally hit a snag. Sometimes your code won't run as expected, or you might notice unexpected behavior where the AI interprets your intent incorrectly.

Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate issues and get back on track:

<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0W8bsbHh2p8?si=p4kWhkdu0PEbgGXm" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use the Try to Fix Button First">
    Click the **Try to Fix** button when an error shows up. Lovable will scan your logs, detect the issue, and attempt a quick fix. It's your fastest first move. If that doesn't work, it's time to dig deeper.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Diagnose Unexpected Behavior">
    Your code may run without errors but not behave as intended. That's **unexpected behavior**—harder to spot and harder to fix. Try this:

    - **Review your original prompt** to confirm your instructions.
    - **Break it down**: Check individual components and logic.
    - **Add visuals**: Use screenshots to clarify what went wrong.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write More Effective Prompts">
    Clear, structured prompts lead to better results. Use this format:

    1. **Project Overview** – What are you building?
    2. **Page Structure** – List key pages/components.
    3. **Navigation Logic** – Describe user flow.
    4. **Visual Aids** – Upload wireframes or screenshots.
    5. **Implementation Steps** – Lay out the build order.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build in Logical Order">
    Structure matters. Follow this recommended flow:

    1. Create layout and pages.
    2. Connect Supabase or your backend.
    3. Set up authentication and user roles.
    4. Plan and organize feature logic.
    5. Prompt Lovable to implement features.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Plan Mode for Clarity">
    When unsure, switch to **Plan Mode**:

    - Ask Lovable to **analyze your project state**.
    - Request a **recap of attempted solutions**.
    - Prompt for **new directions** to solve persistent problems.
  </Step>
  <Step title="If You're Still Stuck: Advanced Tactics">
    Still no luck? Try this:

    - **Be exact** – Describe the bug and your expectations clearly.
    - **Use images** – Screenshots or videos help illustrate problems.
    - **Ask directly** – "What else can we try?"
    - **Rollback** – Restore to a working version and rebuild incrementally.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What's Going Wrong? Common Troubleshooting Areas

Troubleshooting generally falls into these categories:

1. **UI or Layout Glitches**
2. **API or Backend Issues**
3. **Prompt Misinterpretations**
4. **AI Unresponsiveness or Misbehavior**
5. **Platform or Integration Errors**

Use the accordions below to identify specific issues and actions:

### Domain Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Custom Domain Setup">
    To connect your custom domain to your Lovable app:

    1. Navigate to Project → Settings → Domains in Lovable
    2. Click "Add Domain" and enter your domain name
    3. Update your DNS settings as instructed
    4. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours)

    <Info>
      Custom domain functionality requires a paid Lovable plan.
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="DNS Configuration">
    Example DNS settings for your domain registrar:

    ```
    # For apex domain (example.com):
    Type: A
    Name: @
    Value: 76.76.21.21
    
    # For www subdomain:
    Type: CNAME
    Name: www
    Value: yourapp.lovable.app
    ```

    #### **DNS Settings Explanation:**

    - **A Record:** Points your root domain to Lovable's IP address
    - **CNAME Record:** Creates an alias from www to your Lovable app
    - **TTL (Time-to-Live):** Set to 3600 (1 hour) or lower for faster propagation

    #### **DNS Verification:**

    To verify your DNS settings are correct, you can use:

    - [**<u>DNSChecker.org</u>**](https://dnschecker.org/)
    - [**<u>MXToolbox</u>**](https://mxtoolbox.com/)
    - Command line: `dig example.com` or `nslookup example.com`
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="SSL Certificate Issues">
    Lovable automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains. If you're experiencing SSL issues:

    - Ensure your DNS is properly configured
    - Check if your domain has CAA records that might restrict certificate issuance
    - Wait up to 24 hours for the certificate to be issued
    - Verify your browser isn't caching an old certificate
    - Check for certificate transparency logs to see if a certificate was issued
    - Contact Lovable support if issues persist

    #### **Common SSL Errors:**

    - **ERR_CERT_COMMON_NAME_INVALID:** Domain doesn't match certificate
    - **ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID:** Certificate not trusted by browser
    - **SEC_ERROR_UNKNOWN_ISSUER:** Certificate issuer unknown
    - **SSL_ERROR_BAD_CERT_DOMAIN:** Domain doesn't match certificate

    <Info>
      \*\*SSL Security Note: \*\*Lovable uses Let's Encrypt to provision SSL certificates. These certificates are valid for 90 days and are automatically renewed.

    Once connected to GitHub, you can work with different branches:

    #### **Branch Switching Steps**

    ```
    # To switch from main to dev:
    1. In Dev Mode, open the Git panel
    2. Select the branch dropdown

    </Note>
    #### **Branch Management:**

    - **Create a new branch:** Click "Create new branch" in the Git panel
    - **Delete a branch:** Use the GitHub interface (not available directly in Lovable)
    - **Default branch:** Set in GitHub repository settings

    If you can't switch branches:

    - Commit or stash any uncommitted changes
    - Check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten
    - Try refreshing the Lovable editor
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Repository sync issues">
    - Check your [GitHub permissions](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authentication Issues">
    If you're having trouble with GitHub authentication:

    - Reconnect your GitHub account in Lovable

    If your push is rejected:

    1. Pull the latest changes from the remote repository
    2. Resolve any conflicts
    3. Try pushing again

## Comprehensive Debugging Manual

[This document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dfIy5rtkPN9Zi4smX1VAbfbhAiEyBvVw8p7B8kJiEVs/edit?tab=t.0) or [this website](https://kb-lovable.netlify.app/?tab=errors#errors) were written by a Lovable power user in our Discord community.

### How to use it

1. **Download** it as `Comprehensive_Debugging_Manual.md`.
2. **Upload** it to your GitHub project.
3. Prompt Lovable: "Read this document. Let me know if it helps. Then create a prompt I should use to troubleshoot this issue."
4. After Lovable responds, say: "Before you proceed, explain in detail why you think this will work. Wait for my approval."

This ensures deeper understanding before implementing any fix.
