Lovable offers two methods for embedding videos into your projects. Below, we’ll cover both options step by step:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Linking to an external video">
    <Tip>
      The simplest and recommended way to incorporate a video is by linking to one hosted externally, like on YouTube.
    </Tip>
    <CodeGroup>

    ```txt Example prompt
    Embed this video
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ 
    in the hero content section.
    ```

    </CodeGroup>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using a video from your GitHub public folder">
    <Warning>
      Uploading large videos to your GitHub repo can cause it to grow in size, which can affect Lovable performance (longer repo cloning times, slower startup of previews/sandbox).

      A better option is to use hosted services (like YouTube) or file storage options like S3, essentially giving you a URL that you can reference, as described in the previous steps.
    </Warning>
    You can upload videos to your project’s GitHub repository and reference them directly. Here’s how:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Connect your GitHub repository ">
        First, make sure your project is linked to a GitHub repo. [Here’s how to set up your repo](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Access the public folder">
        Inside your connected repository, navigate to the `public` directory. This folder is specifically used for hosting project assets like images, videos, and other media.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Upload a video">
        You can now add your video to the public folder by either dragging and dropping it or clicking **"choose your files"** to browse and upload the file from your local machine.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Commit the file">
        After selecting your video file, enter a brief commit message (e.g., "Adds a Mars video to be used in the app") and click **"Commit changes"**.
        ![Committing video file](/assets/using-videos-github-commiting.png)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Get the video path">
        Once the upload is complete, click on the video file and use the copy icon  :octicons-copy-16:  to copy its path. You’ll need this path in the next step.
        ![Copy video file path](/assets/using-videos-github-selecting.png)
      </Step>
      <Step title="Reference the video in Lovable">
        Now, you can embed the video by specifying the file path in your prompt. For example, you can use a prompt like this one:

        <CodeGroup>

        ```bash Example prompt
        Insert an additional video into the introduction section using this file: 
        public/mars-video-nasa.mp4
        ```

        </CodeGroup>

        Ensure you use the exact file path you copied earlier.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
    To see these methods in action, explore one of the example projects: [Lovable using videos example project](https://lovable.dev/projects/380835ab-c8d7-4f45-9b0d-51ec04294457). You’ll find real prompts demonstrating how videos are integrated using both methods.
