Lovable offers two methods for embedding videos into your projects: by linking to an external video (such as YouTube) or by using videos uploaded to the public folder in your GitHub repository. Below, we’ll cover both options step by step.


## Linking to an external video

<Tip>
The simplest and recommended way to incorporate a video is by linking to one hosted externally, like on YouTube.
</Tip>

<CodeGroup>
  ```txt Example prompt
  Embed this video
  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ 
  in the hero content section.
  ```
</CodeGroup>



## Using a video from your GitHub public folder

<Warning>
Uploading large videos to your GitHub repo can cause it to grow in size, which can affect Lovable performance (longer repo cloning times, slower startup of previews/sandbox).

A better option is to use hosted services (like YouTube) or file storage options like S3, essentially giving you a URL that you can reference, as described in the previous steps.
</Warning>

You can upload videos to your project’s GitHub repository and reference them directly. Here’s how:

**Connect your GitHub repository** - First, make sure your project is linked to a GitHub repo. [Here’s how to set up your repo](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/git-integration).

**Access the public folder** - Inside your connected repository, navigate to the `public` directory. This folder is specifically used for hosting project assets like images, videos, and other media.

**Upload a video** - You can now add your video to the public folder by either dragging and dropping it or clicking **"choose your files"** to browse and upload the file from your local machine.

**Commit the file** - After selecting your video file, enter a brief commit message (e.g., "Adds a Mars video to be used in the app") and click **"Commit changes"**.

**Get the video path** - Once the upload is complete, click on the video file and use the copy icon  :octicons-copy-16:  to copy its path. You’ll need this path in the next step.

**Reference the video in Lovable** - Now, you can embed the video by specifying the file path in your prompt. For example, you can use a prompt like this one:

<CodeGroup>
  ```bash Example prompt
  Insert an additional video into the introduction section using this file: 
  public/mars-video-nasa.mp4
  ```
</CodeGroup>

Ensure you use the exact file path you copied earlier.
