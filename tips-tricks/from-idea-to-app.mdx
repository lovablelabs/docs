> **“I have no clue what I’m doing... but I know exactly what I want to build.”**

If that sounds like you, you're in the right place.

## Who This Is For

You’ve got an idea.

You’ve tried AI tools, written notes, maybe even opened a few projects.

But you’re stuck between inspiration and execution.

**This guide will help you:**

- Go from vague concept to concrete product
- Avoid common mistakes
- Use Lovable the smart way—especially if you’re not a developer

## The Common Pitfall: Building Before You Plan

A lot of users fall into the same trap: `They start building before they’ve clarified what they’re building.`

**The result?**

- Errors on top of errors
- Confused AI agents and AI-generated errors
- Projects that veer off track or feel “`too far gone to fix`”

## Best Practices for Turning Ideas Into Real Products

### 1. Start Outside Lovable

Many builders—including livestream guest MP—spend time shaping their ideas _before_ opening Lovable.

Try this:

- Record a voice note explaining your idea naturally (MP uses Granola for this)
- Paste it into GPT or Claude to get an expanded version in clear product terms
- Ask AI to act as a designer, PM, or developer and critique or co-draft a PRD (Product Requirements Document)

Use Lovable when you're ready to go from clear vision to working prototype.

### 2. **Write It Out First**

Before you prompt the AI, spend 15 minutes writing:

- What does your product do?
- Who it's for (even if it's just you)
- What the _simplest & minimum version_ should include

<Tip>
  **Turn this into a list of features or use cases:**

  Write it as a list of user stories or features and feed it into chat mode or GPT to get a PRD (Product Requirements Document).
</Tip>

### 3. Choose Your Build Style Wisely

There are two valid approaches to building with Lovable:

1. **Front-End First (Recommended for Beginners)**
   - Start with mock data
   - Build layouts, flows, and logic without connecting a database
   - Once satisfied, plug in Supabase and go live
2. **Back-to-Front**:
   - Connect Supabase from Day 1
   - Build and test each feature one by one
   - Best for advanced users comfortable debugging

If you're new, **choose front-end first.** You'll:

- Avoid complex SQL errors
- Iterate faster
- Stay focused on design \+ usability

<Tip>
  MP used front-end first for speed, clarity, and debugging ease. It helped him learn fast and ship quicker.
</Tip>

### 4. Use Chat Mode as a Thought Partner

Chat Mode isn’t just a chatbot—it’s your project-aware assistant.

It knows your files, your database schema, your logs.

Use it to:

- Debug issues with context
- Break down vague ideas into structured components
- Brainstorm, plan, and iterate
- Translate vague ideas into working flows

<Tip>
  Try this prompt:

  ```
  I want to build a dog breeding management app. Here's what I need it to do: [list]. Can you break this down into steps or components to build?
  
  I’m building a job coaching app. Here’s what I want it to do: [list]. What’s the simplest version to test?
  ```
</Tip>

### 5. Break It Down into Bricks

Don’t build everything at once. Split your idea into **bricks**:

- Each brick = one feature, component, or flow
- Build one at a time
- Test, refine, then move on

Ask Chat Mode to help plan this with prompts like:

```
Here’s my app idea. Can you break it into features or steps I should build?
```

```
Break this idea into buildable features I can test one at a time.
```

### 6. **Prompt with Purpose**

Before each prompt, ask:

```
What am I trying to build right now?
```

Be specific. Avoid mid-conversation shifts—AI needs consistent intent to help you properly.

### 7. Avoid the Infinite Error Loop

Stuck? Don’t click “Try to Fix” 10 times.

Instead:

- Open browser dev tools (Console tab)
- Copy the actual error
- Paste it into Chat Mode to investigate
- Or remix the project without your database to simplify debugging

<Tip>
  Lovable now reads console logs automatically—no copy-paste needed for most cases.
</Tip>

### 8. Remix If Things Get Messy

Projects evolve. If things feel tangled:

- Remix your project (it clones the project, you keep the original)
- Start fresh with what you’ve learned
- Keep the new build focused and structured
- Keep what works. Drop what doesn’t.

### 9. **Use Real Validation, Fast**

A user told us he didn’t build to sell. He sent a rough prototype to 10 users in DMs. One asked to pay immediately. By Friday, Stripe was integrated.

Validate by:

- Asking real users, “Would this help you?”
- Getting quick feedback, not perfection
- Letting real interest guide your next steps

### 10. Get Better by Building Bad Ideas

[MP](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwHNw8aeYCI&ab_channel=Lovable) built 100\+ throwaway projects:

- Message-for-a-stranger app
- 90s nostalgia generator
- AI interview prep tool

Each one helped him test a skill:

- Building UI with no backend
- Adding profanity filters
- Connecting AI APIs
- Managing user flow

<Tip>
  Lesson: 

  **Build things that don’t need to exist—so you’re ready when something does.**
</Tip>

## Builder’s Checklist

1. Write your idea in 5-10 bullet points
2. List out core features (use bullets) in an MVP (minimum viable product)
3. Decide: Front-End First or Back-to-Front
4. Use Chat Mode to co-plan and debug
5. Build in bricks: 1 feature at a time
6. Only connect Supabase when ready
7. Remix if errors pile up
8. Get feedback before going live

## Final Tip: You're the First User

- Design for yourself first.
- Test like your future users would.
- Think like a product designer.

And remember: you’re building something only you could imagine.

> You don’t need to know how to code.\
> You just need a clear idea, a good plan, and a little patience.\
> Lovable will help with the rest.
