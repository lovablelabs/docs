[Lovable Cloud](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud) is designed for speed, simplicity, and reliability. You can build, host, and scale confidently, knowing you can always take your project with you.

This guide explains how you can self-host and move your Lovable Cloud project to another provider, like Supabase.

<Warning>
  **It is not possible to migrate users at the moment**. Plan the migration before your app accumulates real users you don't want to lose.
</Warning>

## Key principles

- **You own your code**. \
  Use our [GitHub integration](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/github) to export your code anytime. Clone, export, and self-host without restriction.
- **You own your data**. \
  Your database, storage, and configurations can be exported or migrated to another provider.
- **Lovable is open source at its core**. \
  Everything runs on open standards and open-source technologies. No proprietary frameworks, no hidden dependencies.
- **We earn your trust through quality, not control**. \
  Lovable Cloud is designed to be the easiest, fastest, and most enjoyable place to build. Migration is always possible because we want you to stay by choice, not necessity.

## Migration flow: Lovable Cloud to Supabase

Follow the steps below to migrate your Lovable Cloud project to Supabase. For more information on Supabase specific steps, see [Supabase Documentation](https://supabase.com/docs).

### 1. Create a new Supabase project

Follow the steps below to create a new Supabase project.

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) → **New project**
2. Choose your organization and fill in:
   - **Project name:** any name
   - **Database password:** strong password
   - **Region:** closest to your users
3. Click **Create new project** and wait around 2 minutes for the project to initialize.
4. From your new Supabase project settings, **save these values**:
   - `Project ID`
   - `Public API Key` (anon key)
   - `Project URL`: `https://[your-project-id].supabase.co`

### 2. Update environment variables

Replace Lovable Cloud values with new Supabase credentials in your `.env` file.

1. In your Lovable project, go to **Code.**
2. Locate `.env` file.
3. Update Lovable Cloud values with new Supabase credentials:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID="your-new-project-id"
VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="your-new-anon-key"
VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-new-project-id.supabase.co"
```

4. Save changes.

### 3. Update Supabase configuration

Replace Lovable Cloud project ID with new Supabase project ID in your `supabase/config.toml`file.

1. In your Lovable project, go to **Code.**
2. Locate `supabase/config.toml` file.
3. Update Lovable Cloud project ID with new Supabase project ID:

```
project_id = "your-new-project-id"
```

4. Save changes.

### 4. Run database migrations

Each Lovable Cloud project includes SQL migration files in the `supabase/migrations/` folder.

Run them in **chronological order** based on the timestamp in the filename. They are ordered from earliest to latest. For example:

```
20251008155159_[hash].sql   # first - earliest
20251008155215_[hash].sql   # second
```

For each migration file in your Lovable Cloud project, follow the steps below:

1. Copy the entire SQL content from each migration file.
1. Paste it into the **SQL editor** in your new Supabase project.
3. Run and wait for success message.

<Tip>
  If a migration fails, check the migration order, table dependencies, and SQL syntax errors.
</Tip>

### 5. Export and import your data

Export the data from your Lovable Cloud project and then manually import it to your new Supabase project.

**Export each table with data from your Lovable Cloud project:**

1. Go to **Cloud → Database → Table**.
2. Click **Export CSV**.
3. Save the file.

**Import CSV files to corresponding tables in your new Supabase project:**

1. Go to **Table Editor**.
2. For each table, click **Insert → Import data from CSV**.
3. Map columns correctly.
4. Click **Import data**.

### 6. Reconfigure authentication

If your Lovable Cloud project requires authentication, you need to manually reconfigure auth providers in your new Supabase project.

1. In your new Supabase project, go to **Authentication → Sign In / Providers**.
2. Enable and configure each provider.
3. In your OAuth app settings (for example, Google Console, GitHub),\
   update **redirect URLs** to use your new Supabase project URL.

### 7. Migrate storage files

Download any files from storage buckets in your Lovable Cloud project and upload them to your new Supabase project.

1. In your Lovable project, go to **Cloud → Storage**.
1. Download files from your storage buckets (manually or via API).
2. In Supabase, go to **Storage** and upload files to corresponding buckets (manually or via API).

### 8. Set up environment variables and secrets

If you are using any external services in your Lovable Cloud project, you need to manually reconfigure API keys and credentials in your new Supabase project.

- In your new Supabase project, go to **Edge Functions → Manage Secrets**.
- Add any API keys or external service credentials.
- Save changes.

### 9. Verify everything works

When you are done with all off the steps, your app runs entirely on your Supabase backend. Make sure that everything works, for example:

- App loads without errors
- You can create and read database records
- Authentication works
- Storage uploads/downloads succeed

## Advanced: CLI Migration Option

For developers comfortable with the command line:

```
# 1. Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g @supabase/cli
# or
brew install supabase/tap/supabase

# 2. Update config files (.env + supabase/config.toml)

# 3. Link to your new Supabase project
supabase login
supabase link --project-ref your-new-project-id

# 4. Push all migrations
supabase db push

# 5. Verify schema
supabase db diff
```
