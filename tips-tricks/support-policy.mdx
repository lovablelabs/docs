## Who can contact Support?
Support is available to all of our paying customers. Only requests originating from Lovable account email addresses that are part of a paying workspace will receive official support responses.

## Scope
Lovable’s support covers the following areas:
- Billing issues
- Platform bugs
- Account management
- Workarounds or solutions to known issues
- General guidance on using Lovable
- General questions about Lovable

Lovable's support does not cover:
- Project-specific debugging
- Guidance with implementation of third-party or open-source integrations

## Channels
To contact support, you must go through the support form found [here](https://lovable.dev/support). If the form is unavailable, you can also email support at support@lovable.dev. 
After you've submitted your request, you'll receive a near instant AI response to your inquiry. 
If that doesn't resolve your issue or answer your question, you can request to be routed to a human agent.

All users, free and paying, can access our vibrant and helpful community in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/lovable-dev) for community support. 
Lovable team members and champions may participate in community discussions, but official support is only guaranteed through the above mentioned channels.

For platform-wide issues, updates will be posted on our [status page](https://status.lovable.dev/).
