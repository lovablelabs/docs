description: "Understanding daily and monthly message limits for Lovable"
---

LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

<Note>Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from day to day or month to month.</Note>

## All Plans

* **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day&#x20;

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

<Note>
  Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits.&#x20;
  All other messages count regardless of their outcome.
</Note>

## Free Plan

* **5 free messages per day**

## Upgrading and Downgrading Plans

### Upgrading

When upgrading your plan, the cost is adjusted based on the time left in your current billing cycle. You’ll only pay the difference between what you’ve already paid and the cost of the new plan for the remaining days in the billing period. This amount will be charged immediately.

### Downgrading

When downgrading your plan:

* **No immediate changes** occur to your subscription.

* The downgrade will take effect at the **start of the next billing period**, at which point you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.

## Legacy Plans

Some early access users are "grandfathered" on their existing plans, but can choose to move to the new plans before the old ("pro") plan is officially deprecated.

## Common Issues and Troubleshooting

### Pricing Changes or Charges

Lovable sends community and email notifications about any upcoming pricing changes. Please ensure your email is up-to-date in your account settings.

### Errors During Payment Setup

Occasionally, payment setups may fail due to issues with Stripe. If this occurs, double-check your payment details and retry. If problems persist, contact our support team for assistance.

### Change payment cards

You can update your payment method anytime by navigating to **Account Settings > Plans & Billing** and managing your details through Stripe.

### Paid Users Losing Access

This typically happens due to billing issues (e.g., expired cards). Ensure your payment method is valid to avoid interruptions.

### Resolving Overages or Refunds

If you experience message overages or require a refund, reach out to our support team. We handle these on a case-by-case basis to ensure a fair resolution.
