  <Accordion title="'Chat Mode' credits consumption">
    A few weeks ago, we introduced **Chat Mode** as a  (accessible: **Account \> Settings \> Labs**), and the feedback from early testers has been overwhelmingly positive. We've since expanded its capabilities, making it feel like you're chatting with a technology expert who understands your projects and goals inside and out.

    However, these advanced features come with additional costs, so **messages sent in Chat Mode will now count towards your message limit**:

    - 1 Chat Mode message = 1 Edit Mode message = 1 message
    - All pricing tiers have access to Chat Mode
    - There will be no separate message count in settings for Chat Mode
    - Workaround: If you use Edit Mode without asking the AI to write code, it won’t count towards your message limit—**but Chat Mode functionalities won’t be available in that case.**

    We're excited to keep improving Chat Mode and appreciate your continued feedback\!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Try to Fix' button counting as messages">
    Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits only if pressed on the button. If you are trying to [fix errors](/tips-tricks/troubleshooting) with an additional prompt, that counts as message credit.
