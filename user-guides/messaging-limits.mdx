LLMs are expensive, which is why Lovable limits the daily and/or monthly messages that you can send.

## All Plans

- **Daily limit:** 5 free messages per day

Designed to give users a chance to explore and experience Lovable's features at no cost.

## Free Plan

- 5 free messages per day (chat or edit mode)
- Maximum of 30 messages per month

## Available Paid Plans

Each paid plan includes a set number of allocated messages, plus 5 free daily messages available to all users.

## Upgrading and Downgrading Plans

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upgrading">
    When upgrading your plan, the cost is adjusted based on the time left in
    your current billing cycle. You’ll only pay the difference between what
    you’ve already paid and the cost of the new plan for the remaining days in
    the billing period. This amount will be charged immediately.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Downgrading">
    When downgrading your plan: No immediate changes occur to your subscription.
    The downgrade will take effect at the start of the next billing period, at
    which point you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.
    you will be billed for the new, lower-cost plan.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Legacy Plans">
    Some early access users are "grandfathered" on their existing plans, but can
    choose to move to the new plans before the old ("pro") plan is officially
    deprecated.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Chat Mode' credits consumption">
    A few weeks ago, we introduced **Chat Mode** as a  (accessible: **Account > Settings > Labs**), and the feedback from early testers has been overwhelmingly positive. We've since expanded its capabilities, making it feel like you're chatting with a technology expert who understands your projects and goals inside and out.

    However, these advanced features come with additional costs, so **messages sent in Chat Mode will now count towards your message limit**:

    - 1 Chat Mode message = 1 Edit Mode message = 1 message
    - All pricing tiers have access to Chat Mode
    - There will be no separate message count in settings for Chat Mode
    - Workaround: If you use Edit Mode without asking the AI to write code, it won’t count towards your message limit—**but Chat Mode functionalities won’t be available in that case.**

    We're excited to keep improving Chat Mode and appreciate your continued feedback\!

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="'Try to Fix' button counting as messages">
    Messages triggered by "Ask the AI to fix" don't count toward your usage limits only if pressed on the button. If you are trying to [fix errors](/tips-tricks/troubleshooting) with an additional prompt, that counts as message credit.

    <Note>
      All other messages count regardless of their outcome.

  <Accordion title="Messages roll over">
    Messages do not roll over. Unused messages will **not accumulate** from:

    - Day to day (for the free tier)
