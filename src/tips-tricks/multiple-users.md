# :busts_in_silhouette: Multiple users

At this time, GPT Engineer doesn't fully support team plans or multiple users on the same project. We are actively considering this feature for future updates. However, we’ve noticed that some users have found a workaround for collaborating on the same project.

The workaround involves creating a single account (registering through the regular sign-up process) and then sharing the credentials for that account with the users you want to give access to. 

This allows multiple people to log in and work on the same project (not at the same time, however!)

!!! warning "Be cautious when sharing account credentials"
    If you choose to share an account with others, please only do so with trusted users. Everyone using the shared account will have access to the same information, projects, and edits, and it will be impossible to track who made specific changes. 
    
    For security and accountability, we recommend being very cautious when sharing your credentials.

!!! warning "Consider separate login credentials"
    If you signed up using Google or GitHub sign-in, and you share those login details with others, you are also granting them access to your Google or GitHub account. This could expose sensitive personal information. 
    
    A safer approach would be to create a separate email account specifically for GPT Engineer and share that account instead, to avoid giving access to unrelated services like your Gmail or GitHub repositories.

Please note that this is not an officially supported feature of GPT Engineer but rather a workaround that we've observed users employing. 

We recommend considering the risks before proceeding with this method.
