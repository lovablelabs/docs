# :rocket: Getting started

This is a simple tutorial to get you started with the basics of gptengineer.app. 

We hope you're excited to contribute to the docs!

We will guide you through the process of creating a project, making improvements, and deploying your project.

## Creating a project

To create a new project, login to `gptengineer.app` and then write what you want to build in the textbox.

Once you have written what you want to build, click on the `Create` button.

This will take you to the generation page where you can see the code that is being generated for you. Once it is done, you will see a popup taking you to the editor where you can preview the site.

## Making improvements

To make improvements to your project, open the project editor and request a change in the chat.

<video autoplay loop src="/assets/improve.mp4"> video </video>

Do you want to edit the code directly? You can access your project on Github and make [changes to the code yourself](features/git-integration.md).

## Reverting changes

If you don't like the changes made by the AI and want to go back to a previous version, you can revert your project to any previous change. You can do so by clicking on the "Revert" button in the dropdown menu for edits.

<video autoplay loop src="/assets/revert.mp4"> video </video>

## Deploying your project

Once you've made a project you're happy with, you can [deploy it](features/deploy.md).
