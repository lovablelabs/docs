Learn how to go from idea to a fully functional, animated landing page, using AI \+ a sprinkle of razzle dazzle.

## Two Ways to Build Landing Pages

### 1. One-Shot Generation

Let Lovable do the heavy lifting. Just write a single prompt and let the AI generate your entire landing page.

**Prompt Example:**

```
You are a CRO expert. Build a landing page for a space tourism agency targeting wealthy individuals. The experience includes zero-gravity flights. Follow conversion rate optimization best practices. 
```

<Tip>
  Add specific audience, features, or tone to help Lovable make better assumptions.
</Tip>

### 2. Section-by-Section

Prefer more control? Build one piece at a time: hero, pricing, FAQs, and more.

**Example flow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1">
    Generate a blank hero section
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 2">
    Click into any section with [visual edits](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/visual-edit) to:

    - Change text, colors, size
    - Move or delete elements
    - Tweak layout or animations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 3">
    Add images, animations, pricing tables (details at the bottom)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Step 4">
    Refactor styling \+ add branding \+ request a theme like:

    - Dark mode
    - Neo-brutalism
    - Glassmorphism
    - Futuristic fonts (e.g., _Space Grotesque_)

    <Tip>
      "Make the layout more elegant and smaller" can work wonders.
    </Tip>

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="P5.js + Custom Animations">
    For visual magic like orbiting horses or flickering stars:

    - Use P5.js sketches in hero sections
    - Animate backgrounds (fix opacity \+ contrast for visibility)
    - Add particle effects or timeline scroll animations

    üõ† If it fails to render, use:

    - Chat mode for debugging

    - Ask it to reset \+ use working reference code

    <Tip>
      Use Chat Mode to debug P5.js when things break.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Customize Favicon">
    Favicons need to be 64x64 `.ico` or `.png`.

    **Steps:**

    1. Generate an icon on Replicate
    2. Resize via [favicon.io](http://favicon.io) or similar
    3. Paste image into prompt:

    ```
    Change the website favicon to this.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Contact Forms that Actually Work">
    Collect emails and respond automatically with **Resend**.

    **Use case:**

    - Contact Sales form
    - Confirmation email to user
    - Notification email to your team

    **Prompt:**

    ```
    Implement a contact form that uses Resend.
    Send a confirmation email to the user and a notification to my team.
    ```

    <Tip>
      Need to limit usage or detect abuse? Add IP tracking with Supabase fingerprinting.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What Type of Landing Page Should You Build?">
    Here‚Äôs what you can build:

    - Blog
    - Portfolio
    - SaaS site
    - Nonprofit
    - Course signup
    - Event promotion

    üëâ Try building one of each to get comfortable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO) 101">
    Your landing page‚Äôs goal = 1 action.

    **That might be:**

    - Booking a call
    - Buying a seat (like HorseX)
    - Signing up for a waitlist

    **CRO best practices:**

    - Limit CTAs
    - Keep headlines clear
    - Match layout to audience expectations
    - Use social proof \+ trust signals

    Lovable understands the term ‚ÄúCRO optimized,‚Äù so use it in your prompts.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Static vs Dynamic Pages">
    Lovable builds static pages by default.

    To make it dynamic:

    - Add forms (e.g., to collect leads)
    - Connect to Supabase
    - Add checkout using Stripe
    - CMS integration (e.g., with Strapi)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Final Polish = Razzle Dazzle">
    Here‚Äôs what separates a $$2K site from a $$

    10K site:

    - Animations
    - Fonts \+ spacing
    - Branding consistency
    - Copywriting polish
    - Loading speeds
    - SEO setup (Lovable now supports robots.txt and OG tags)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add Real Product Previews">
    Let visitors **test your product directly** from the landing page. You can embed mini-apps using Supabase and external APIs like GROQ.

    **Example:** A ‚ÄúMake it professional‚Äù email previewer powered by the GROQ API:

    - Connect to Supabase first to avoid wiring issues later
    - Use `chat mode` to help Lovable understand and implement new APIs
    - Ask for fingerprinting or usage limits via IP if needed

    **Prompt:**

    ```
    Add a section where users can preview our AI email assistant.
    Connect to Supabase. Use GROQ API for email enhancement.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use 21st.dev for Beautiful Animations">
    Enhance your visual design with high-quality animations and components:

    - Floating glowing particles
    - Scroll-based sticky sections
    - Timeline animations
    - Logo carousels
    - Modal popups for video demos

    <Tip>
      If animations don't show up, use chat mode to debug or re-implement from scratch. You can also upload screenshots and say:\
      _‚ÄúPlease animate this background section.‚Äù_
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add Modal Popups (Videos & More)">
    Want to show a demo without cluttering the hero?

    **Use modals:**

    - Embed YouTube or demo videos
    - Trigger on button click (e.g. ‚ÄúWatch Demo‚Äù)
    - Common prompt term: `modal popup`

    **Prompt:**

    ```
    When the ‚ÄúWatch Demo‚Äù button is clicked, open a modal popup with this video.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Add a Trust Section with Real Logos">
    Social proof matters.

    - Create a ‚ÄúTrusted By‚Äù section with animated company logos.
    - Ensure logos stay as image files, not SVG paths.
    - Avoid grayed-out overlays.

    **Prompt:**

    ```
    Add a ‚ÄúTrusted by‚Äù section using real company logos.
    Keep them as images, not SVGs. Use 21st.dev animations.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Hero Animations & UI Polish">
    Don‚Äôt settle for static hero sections:

    - Animate words (cycle between phrases)
    - Add floating shapes (circles, gradients)
    - Match color palette across hero, headings, and timeline

    Example prompts:

    ```
    Animate the word in the hero title to cycle between "intelligence" and "assistance"
    Add floating purple circles in the background
    Make the heading text use the primary purple gradient
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Sticky Navigation + Custom Navbar">
    Want smooth scrolling to sections?

    - Use a sticky nav bar
    - Replace default nav with one from [21st.dev](http://21st.dev)
    - Make sure it links to **sections**, not new pages

    <Tip>
      Use screenshots and say: _‚ÄúMake this navbar scroll to page sections and match our theme.‚Äù_
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Mobile Responsiveness">
    Lovable auto-generates mobile-friendly pages‚Äîbut test and tweak:

    - Add margin and padding via visual edit
    - Test modals, animations, and layouts on mobile
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What‚Äôs the Parallax Effect?">
    **Parallax** creates a sense of **depth** by having background elements move at a different speed than foreground ones as you scroll. It‚Äôs like walking through a forest in a video game ‚Äî trees in the front move faster than mountains in the back.

    **Why it‚Äôs cool:**

    - Adds immersion
    - Makes your landing page feel more dynamic and interactive
    - Visually separates sections in a subtle way

    **Prompt Example:**

    ```
    Add a parallax scroll effect to the background of the hero section.
    Make the stars move slower than the text and images.
    ```

    <Tip>
      Use it sparingly. Too much parallax = overwhelming.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What‚Äôs Isometry (Isometric Design)?">
    **Isometric design** creates a 3D-like effect using 2D graphics, typically at a 30¬∞ angle. Think of games like _Monument Valley_ or old-school _Sim City_. Everything looks ‚Äútilted‚Äù but perfectly aligned ‚Äî no perspective distortion.

    **Why use it:**

    - Clean, futuristic aesthetic
    - Makes your app visuals look more sophisticated
    - Great for tech, data, and AI themes

    **Prompt Example:**

    ```
    Use isometric illustrations for the product feature section.
    Make the graphics look like a futuristic dashboard in 3D.
    ```

    You can also import isometric illustrations from:

    - [Storyset](https://storyset.com)
    - [Icons8 Isometric](https://icons8.com/icons/set/isometric)
    - [3D Icons Library](https://www.3dicons.com/)

    <Tip>
      Isometric graphics pair really well with **glassmorphism** or dark-themed UIs for modern SaaS pages.
