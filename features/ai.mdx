<Warning>
  This feature is currently in beta. We’re actively iterating on both pricing and functionality based on user feedback.
</Warning>

Normally, adding AI to an app means hunting down API keys, setting up billing with providers, and wiring it all together yourself. Lovable AI makes it simple to quickly add powerful AI features to your app so you can start building smarter and more engaging apps right away.

Some examples include:

- **AI summaries** – automatically condense long text into clear takeaways
- **AI chatbot or agent** – build conversational helpers into your app
- **Sentiment detection** – understand user feedback at scale
- **Document Q&A** – let users ask questions directly against your content
- **Creative generation** – brainstorming, copy drafting, or idea expansion
- **Multilingual translation** – serve global users seamlessly
- **Task completion** – automate repetitive or multi-step workflows (agent functionality)
- **Image and document analysis** -  quickly extract, summarize, and interpret key information from images and documents, turning unstructured content into actionable insights
- **Workflow automation** -  handle repetitive tasks, making decisions, and optimizing processes to save time and reduce errors.

## Enabling Lovable AI

<Note>
  For the best experience, we recommend using Lovable AI with [Lovable Cloud](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud).
</Note>

By default, Lovable AI is enabled at workspace and user level when using Lovable Cloud. This means Lovable automatically adds AI functionality when requested, using **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as the default model. 

If you want to use a different model or combination of models, you can specify that in the prompt when requesting AI functionality. For an overview of supported AI models, see [Supported AI models](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/ai#supported-ai-models).

### User level

By default, enabling the AI integration is set to **Always allow** on user level. This means Lovable AI will be used for your project. You can change your personal preference from **Settings → Account → Tools**.

Choose between:

- **Always allow**: Lovable automatically performs the action, which means you are not asked to review or approve the action.
- **Ask each time**: Lovable asks for your approval whenever the action is needed. For example, if you want to add a chatbot, you can:
  - **Allow**: enable the integration for the current project.
  - **Deny**: decline the integration for this request (you may be asked again later).
  - **Adjust preferences**: set personal defaults for future use.
- **Never allow**: Lovable blocks the action, informs you that AI is required, and instructs you to enable Lovable AI.

## Usage and pricing

Lovable AI runs on a **usage-based pricing model**. This means your costs scale with how much you use and are not covered by your subscription.

Every workspace includes **\$1 of free AI usage per month** to get started. After that, users on paid plans can top up their balance, with costs depending on the underlying model you choose.

<Note>
  **Temporary offering, subject to change:** Until the end of 2025, all users get \$25 Cloud and \$1 AI per month, even on the Free plan.
</Note>

You can track and manage your AI usage costs in **Settings → Usage.** For more details and examples see [Usage-based Cloud and AI pricing](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud#usage-based-cloud-and-ai-pricing).

## Supported AI models

Lovable AI uses **Gemini 2.5 Flash** as its default model, but you can prompt the agent to use a different model or combination of models.

| Model                                                                          | Description                                                                                 | Best For                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [**Gemini 2.5 Pro**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/pro/)               | Smartest and most complex Gemini. High reasoning, large context, slower and most expensive. | Deep reasoning, advanced coding, research, complex multimodal tasks                |
| [**Gemini 2.5 Flash (default)**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash/) | Balanced model. Faster and cheaper than Pro but still capable of reasoning. Mid-range cost. | Assistants, analysis, general workflows where speed + intelligence balance matters |
| [**Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/flash-lite/) | Fastest and cheapest Gemini. Handles simple tasks at scale, less reasoning depth.           | High-volume, lightweight tasks like classification, summarization, translation     |
| [**Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**](https://deepmind.google/models/gemini/image/)     | Optimized for generating images. Very cheap per image, not meant for text reasoning.        | Image generation, quick visual outputs                                             |
| [**GPT-5**](https://openai.com/index/introducing-gpt-5/)                       | Smartest OpenAI model. Strong reasoning, very accurate, but slowest and most expensive.     | Highest-quality reasoning, accuracy-critical apps, complex decision making         |
| [**GPT-5 Mini**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-mini)           | Balanced GPT-5. Cheaper and faster than GPT-5, less complex but strong general use.         | Assistants, mid-complexity reasoning, business workflows                           |
| [**GPT-5 Nano**](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-5-nano)           | Cheapest and fastest GPT-5. Very basic reasoning, best for quick or simple responses.       | Summaries, classification, extraction, high-volume simple tasks                    |
