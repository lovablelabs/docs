Normally, adding AI to an app means hunting down API keys, setting up billing with providers, and wiring it all together yourself. With Lovable AI, everything is built in so you can start building right away.

\
Lovable AI makes it simple to add powerful AI features to your app—without extra accounts, setup, or API keys. Intelligence comes built in.

### How do I use Built-in AI?

AI will automatically be enabled once you request a feature that requires AI functionality, such as chat, summarization, or translation.

Lovable takes care of all the setup behind the scenes—no API keys or external accounts required.

Every project includes **\$1 of free AI usage to get started**. After that, you simply **pay as you go**, with costs depending on the underlying model you choose (e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google).

You can always **_track and manage your AI costs in Settings → Billing_**.

#### What You Can Build

With AI built in, you can quickly create features that make your app smarter and more engaging. Some examples include:

- **AI Summaries** – automatically condense long text into clear takeaways
- **AI Chatbot or Agent** – build conversational helpers into your app
- **Sentiment Detection** – understand user feedback at scale
- **Document Q&A** – let users ask questions directly against your content
- **Creative Generation** – brainstorming, copy drafting, or idea expansion
- **Multilingual Translation** – serve global users seamlessly
- **Task Completion** – automate repetitive or multi-step workflows (agent functionality)

#### Why It Matters

By removing the complexity of API management and billing, Lovable AI makes it easy to bring advanced capabilities into your app. You focus on the product experience—Lovable handles the rest.
