No lock-in. Ever. We believe you should stay with Lovable because we provide the best experience, not because you're forced to.

## Our philosophy on lock-in

At Lovable, we're committed to your freedom:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Open source foundation" icon="code-branch">
    Every line of code we generate uses 100% open source technologies. No proprietary frameworks, no vendor-specific APIs.
  </Card>

  <Card title="You own your code" icon="key">
    The code you build on Lovable is yours. Export it anytime, use it anywhere. 
  </Card>

  <Card title="Complete Data Portability" icon="database">
    All your data can be exported at any time in standard formats.
  </Card>

  <Card title="No Forced Hosting" icon="server">
    Use Lovable's hosting for convenience, or host anywhere you want. 
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
  We're confident that once you experience building with Lovable, you'll want to stay. We don't need lock-in when we provide the best developer experience. This documentation exists so you can build with confidence, knowing you're never trapped.

## How to take your project elsewhere

### Export your code
Use our GitHub integration to export your code directly to your GitHub account, then do whatever you'd like with it.

</Card>

Once exported to GitHub, you can self-host on platforms like:

- Vercel
- Netlify
- AWS
- Your own infrastructure

### Export your data from Lovable Cloud

All data in your Lovable Cloud database can be exported with built-in filtering and CSV export functionality.

</Card>

Export your data as CSV, then import into any database of your choice. PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or any other solution.

### Connect to other backend solutions
Since everything is built on open source technologies, you can export your code through GitHub and connect it to any backend solution you prefer.
With some technical knowledge, you can:

- Swap Lovable Cloud for Supabase, Firebase, or AWS Amplify
- Connect to your own PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB database
- Integrate with custom APIs or microservices architecture
- Use any authentication provider (Auth0, Clerk, NextAuth, custom)

<Note>
  Your frontend code uses standard API patterns, making backend migration straightforward for developers familiar with modern web architecture.
</Note>

### Manage secrets and environment variables

When you self-host your project, you become responsible for managing all secrets and environment variables, such as API keys and database credentials. These will need to be configured in your new hosting environment.
