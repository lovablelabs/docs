## Tips and tricks

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Sitemap for search engine indexing">
    A sitemap helps search engines crawl and index your website efficiently.

    **How to generate a sitemap in Lovable:**

    1. Ask Lovable to _"Create a sitemap with my custom domain"_.
    2. Publish/update your project.
    3. Submit the sitemap to **Google Search Console** under **Sitemaps** using the URL `https://[yourdomain]/sitemap.xml` (replace `[yourdomain]` with your custom domain). \
       Note that if your sitemap has another name, you need to replace `sitemap.xml` in the URL with this name. This can be seen in code viewer under the public file.
    4. Add sitemap`https://[yourdomain]/sitemap.xml` in your robots.txt file (optional)

    Remember to update your sitemap from time to time or make sure it is updated automatically when your website is built.

    Your sitemap will not be automatically available at `https://[youdomain]/sitemap.xml` when you have done this. To check your sitemap, open your command-line interface and type `curl https://[yourdomain]/sitemap.xml`, your sitemap should show up.

  <Accordion title="Robots.txt configuration for search control">
