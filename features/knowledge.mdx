Every project has its own goals, constraints, and preferences. Use the Custom Knowledge tab to capture those. Everything you add here is remembered and applied across your project, making edits smarter and more aligned.\
\
You donâ€™t need to be comprehensive. A few lines of clear direction can go a long way.
