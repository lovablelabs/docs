**Design mode** replaces the old _edit mode_ and brings all design tools together, giving you full visual control over your project.

It combines **themes** and **visual editing** so you can style, refine, and adjust components directly—without writing code or using credits. These tools make it easy to customize projects and stay visually consistent with your brand.

## Why use design mode

Design mode empowers everyone—designers, marketers, and non-technical teammates—to make design changes visually, stay on brand, and move faster.

### Key benefits

- **Consistent branding:** Apply shared themes that reflect your brand’s identity
- **Faster iteration:** Update layouts and text visually—no code or prompts required
- **Accessible editing:** Non-technical users can make confident design changes

### Common use cases

- Designers maintaining brand consistency across multiple projects
- Marketers launching new campaign pages without leaving brand guidelines
- Product managers refining layouts and copy directly
- Teams quickly building prototypes and variants with shared visual styles

## Themes

**Themes** define your project’s core style system—colors, fonts, spacing, and border radius—forming the foundation of your brand’s identity.

### Key capabilities

- **Apply:** Choose from built-in Lovable templates or apply a custom theme
- **Create:** Generate a theme from your current project
- **Customize:** Edit colors, typography, and spacing directly in the UI
- **Share:** Themes are available to all members in your workspace
- **Preview:** Test changes live before applying them

## Visual editing

The **Edit** tab lets you change your project visually, right on the page. It’s designed for fast, intuitive adjustments with full control over layout and spacing.

### Key capabilities

- **Multi-select elements** for batch edits
- **Layout controls** for alignment and positioning
- **Adjust margins and padding** on individual sides of containers
- **Edit text, colors, and fonts** directly from the sidebar
- **Enhanced text formatting** with line breaks and inline styling

## Quick start

1. **Open design mode** from any project (`+` button next to Preview mode or or within the prompt box in the bottom left corner). \
   When opened, you can switch between **Themes** and **Edit** tabs and work on your project’s design from the left-hand panel.
2. **Select a theme** or create your own and apply it to the project.
3. **Select an element** on the page and **edit** it in the left-hand panel.
4. **Preview and save** when you’re happy with the result.
