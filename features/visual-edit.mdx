**Design tools** bring together everything you need to visually customize your project — from high-level themes to detailed visual edits. You can manage your project’s overall look through **Themes** or make quick, targeted changes using **Visual edits**, without writing code or using credits.

To access design tools, go to **Design view** from the `+` button next to Preview.

## Why use design tools

Design tools empower everyone—designers, marketers, and non-technical teammates—to make design changes visually, stay on brand, and move faster.

### Key benefits

- **Consistent branding:** Apply shared themes that reflect your brand’s identity
- **Faster iteration:** Update layouts and text visually—no code or prompts required
- **Accessible editing:** Non-technical users can make confident design changes
- **Live preview**: See every visual change in real time before publishing

### Common use cases

- Designers maintaining brand consistency across multiple projects
- Marketers launching new campaign pages without leaving brand guidelines
- Product managers refining layouts and copy directly
- Teams quickly building prototypes and variants with shared visual styles

## Themes

**Themes** define your project’s core style system—colors, fonts, spacing, and border radius—forming the foundation of your brand’s identity.

### Key capabilities

- **Apply:** Choose from built-in Lovable templates or apply a custom theme
- **Create:** Generate a theme from your current project
- **Import:** Upload a custom CSS file (such as `index.css` or `globals.css`) to turn it into a theme
- **Customize:** Edit colors, typography, and spacing directly in the UI
- **Share:** Themes are available to all members in your workspace
- **Preview:** Test changes live before applying them

## Visual editing

The **Visual edit** mode lets you change your project visually, right on the page. It’s designed for fast, intuitive adjustments with full control over layout and spacing.

### Key capabilities

- **Multi-select elements** for batch edits
- **Layout controls** for alignment and positioning
- **Adjust margins and padding** on individual sides of containers
- **Edit text, colors, fonts, and images** directly from the sidebar
- **Enhanced text formatting** with line breaks and inline styling

## Quick start

1. Open the **Design view** from the `+` button next to Preview.
2. Switch between **Themes** and **Visual edit** tabs to work on your project’s design in the left-hand panel.
   - Go to **Themes** to select a theme or create your own, and apply it to the project.
   - Go to **Visual edits** to select elements in the live preview and edit them visually.

   <Tip>
     For quick access to visual edits, use the **Visual edits** shortcut in the prompt box.

3. **Preview and save** when you’re happy with the result.

<Warning>
  Visually customizing your project does not deduct credits, except when:

  - Making changes to dynamic elements.
  - Prompting the Lovable Agent to modify the design. Use the design tools instead.
