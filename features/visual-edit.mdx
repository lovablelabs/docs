Lovable’s Visual Edits allows you to select elements on the page and either edit them instantly, such as updating text or colors, or use prompts to adjust functionality and layout. This tool is useful for making quick, targeted updates without needing to modify the code manually or use the AI.

  Using Visual Edits does not deduct credits.

## When to use visual edits

Use Visual Edits when you want to:

- Change static text content on your site
- Update fonts, font sizes, or styles
- Modify colors of text, buttons or other elements
- Select a specific element and use prompting to modify its visual appearance or functionality. **Please note** that this prompt will deduct credits as an ordinary prompt.
