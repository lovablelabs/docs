## What is design mode

Design mode replaces the previous _edit mode_ and brings all your design tools together in one place, giving you full control over how your project looks and feels.

It combines **themes** and **visual editing** tools so you can style and adjust all components directly—without writing code or using credits. Together, these tools make it easy to maintain brand consistency and visually customize any project.

You’ll find the **Design** option inside any Lovable project by clicking the `+` button next to **Preview** **mode**, or within the prompt box in the bottom left corner.

When opened, you can switch between **Themes** and **Edit** tabs and work on your project’s design from the left-hand panel.

### Example workflow

1. **Open Design mode**
2. **Select a theme** or create your own
3. **Visually edit** elements on the page using the **Edit** tab
4. **Preview and save** once you’re satisfied with the result

## Why use design mode

Design Mode empowers everyone—designers, marketers, and non-technical teammates—to customize projects visually, stay on brand, and move faster.

### Key benefits

- **Consistent branding:** Apply shared themes that reflect your brand’s identity across all workspace projects
- **Faster iteration:** Update layouts and text visually without relying on code or prompts
- **Accessible editing:** Empower non-technical users to make changes confidently

### Use cases

- Designers maintaining brand consistency across projects
- Marketers launching campaign pages quickly without going off-brand
- Product managers refining page layouts or content directly
- Teams building prototypes or variants faster with shared visual styles

## Themes

Themes define your project’s core styling system—colors, fonts, spacing, and border radius.\
They form the foundation of your brand’s visual identity. 

#### Key capabilities

- **Apply:** Choose from built-in Lovable templates or apply a custom theme
- **Create:** Generate a theme from your current project
- **Customize:** Edit colors, typography, and spacing directly in the UI
- **Share:** Themes are available to all members in your workspace
- **Preview:** Test changes live before applying them

## Visual editing

The **Edit** tab lets you change your project visually, right on the page. It’s designed for fast, intuitive adjustments with full control over layout and spacing. 

#### Key capabilities

- **Multi-select elements** for batch edits
- **Control** **element layout** (alignment and positioning)
- **Adjust margins and padding** on individual sides of containers
- **Edit typography and colors** directly from the sidebar
- **Better text formatting** with line breaks and inline styling
