### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid or mismatched Redirect URI">
    Ensure the redirect/callback URL exactly matches https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler in your IdP.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issuer URL / discovery fails">
    Use the provider's OIDC Issuer URL (not just the domain). For Okta, copy from the Sign-on tab; for Auth0, use your tenant Domain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email not returned">
    Grant the `email` scope and ensure the user account has a primary email.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authorization flow issues">
    Use Authorization Code with a confidential client and client secret. Avoid implicit or PKCE-only app types.
