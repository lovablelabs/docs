We believe trust is the foundation of great experiences. This page explains how Lovable uses your data for model training and how you can opt out.

**Customer Data** means any content, code, text, images, files, or other data that you input, upload, submit, host, or generate through Lovable services, including applications you create using the Lovable platform.

## Quick overview

Every customer can decide how their data is used in Lovable.

- **Free and Pro plans**\
  Customer Data may be used for model training and other business purposes as described in our [Terms of Service](https://lovable.dev/terms). Contact [Lovable Support](https://lovable.dev/support) if you want to opt out of model training or other training-related data usage.
- **Business and Enterprise plans**\
  We do not use your data to train our models. Additionally, you can use the workspace-level control **Settings → Privacy & Security → Data collection opt out** to ensure your data is not used for training or internal evaluation in the future.

## Training data and privacy (Business & Enterprise)

For **Business and Enterprise** workspaces, we **do not use your workspace conversations, code, documents, or any other Customer Data to train our models.** Your information remains private within your workspace and is used only to provide the features you rely on, such as generating content, collaborating with teammates, or improving productivity inside your organization.

If your organization prefers an additional layer of protection, you can opt out of any future training-related data usage at the workspace level.

Workspace admins and owners can enable **Data collection opt out** in **Settings → Privacy & security** to ensure your proprietary code, projects, and workspace data are never used to train AI models or perform internal evaluation.

## How Lovable handles PII

**Personally Identifiable Information or PII** means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked to a specific individual.

We treat PII separately from other Customer Data:

- We will not use raw or identifiable PII for model training.
- We do not sell PII and do not share it with third parties for advertising or marketing.
- We may anonymize and aggregate PII, and once anonymized and aggregated, we may use it for business purposes such as improving the service.

These rules apply across plans and are designed to protect individual users while still allowing us to improve performance, reliability, and product quality using non-identifiable data.
