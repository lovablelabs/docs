We believe trust is the foundation of great experiences. This page explains how Lovable may use your data for model training and how you can opt out.

**Customer Data** means any content, code, text, images, files, or other data that you input, upload, submit, host, or generate through Lovable services, including applications you create using the Lovable platform.

Customer Data _may be_ used for model training and other business purposes as described in our [Terms of Service](https://lovable.dev/terms).

## Data opt-out

Every customer and organization can decide how their data is used in Lovable.

- **Free and Pro plans**\
  If you want to opt out of model training or other training-related data usage, contact [Lovable Support](https://lovable.dev/support).
- **Business and Enterprise plans**\
  If your organization wants to prevent its data from being used for training, you can opt out of any training-related data usage at the workspace level.

  Workspace admins and owners can enable **Data collection opt out** in **Settings → Privacy & security** to ensure your proprietary code, projects, and workspace data are never used to train AI models or perform internal evaluation.

## How Lovable handles PII

**Personally Identifiable Information or PII** means any information that identifies, relates to, describes, or could reasonably be linked to a specific individual.

We treat PII separately from other Customer Data:

- We will not use raw or identifiable PII for model training.
- We do not sell PII and do not share it with third parties for advertising or marketing.
- We may anonymize and aggregate PII, and once anonymized and aggregated, we may use it for business purposes such as improving the service.

These rules apply across plans and are designed to protect individual users while still allowing us to improve performance, reliability, and product quality using non-identifiable data.
