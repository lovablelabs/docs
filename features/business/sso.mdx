---

Single sign-on (SSO) is available for **Business plan and Enterprise plans**, enabling secure, centralized authentication across your organization. With SSO, users can access all their tools with one set of credentials, simplifying access management and improving security.

The workspace **owner**  or **admin** can set up SSO in **Settings → Workspace → Identity**.

Lovable supports both **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** and **SAML** protocols, enabling integration with all major identity providers including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Google Workspace, and more.

## Choose your protocol

Pick the protocol used by your identity provider:

<CardGroup cols="2">
  <Card title="Use OIDC (recommended)" icon="key" href="/features/business/sso/oidc">
    Modern, simpler configuration with standardized scopes and discovery.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use SAML" icon="shield" href="/features/business/sso/saml">
    Enterprise-friendly option with attribute mapping.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  Start sign-in from Lovable. IdP-initiated SSO (launching from your provider's dashboard tile) is not supported.
</Note>

## Prerequisites

To connect your SSO provider to Lovable using OIDC or SAML, you require:

- SSO provider admin access (Okta, Auth0, Microsoft Entra ID, or any other provider you're using)
- Lovable workspace Owner or Admin role

If you use Okta, Auth0, or Microsoft Entra, we have provider-specific documentation for setting up SSO. If you use another provider, we provide some generic instructions.

## OIDC quick reference

- Redirect URI: `https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler`
- Scopes: `openid`, `email`

## SAML quick reference

- ACS URL: https://auth.lovable.dev/\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_/auth/handler
- Audience / Entity ID: https://auth.lovable.dev/\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\_/auth/handler
- Required attribute: `email`

## Okta

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OIDC">
    1. In Okta Admin, under `Applications`, click to create a new app integration using OIDC. You should choose the `Web Application` application type.
    2. In **Sign-in redirect URIs**, add `https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler`
    3. Assign the application to your users/groups who should access Lovable.
    4. Copy the following values in Okta and add them in Lovable → Settings → Workspace → Identity:
       - `Issuer URL` (Sign-on tab → OpenID Connect ID Token)
       - `Client ID`
       - `Client Secret`
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SAML">
    1. In Okta, under `Applications`, click to create a new app integration using SAML 2.0.
    2. **SSO settings**:
       - **Single sign on URL (ACS)**: `https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler`
       - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: `https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler`
       - **Name ID format**: EmailAddress
    3. **Assignments**: Assign the application to required users/groups.
    4. **Get metadata and configure it in Lovable**. Copy the following app metadata URL values and add them in Lovable → Settings → Workspace → Identity:
       1. `EntityID` : use as Issuer in Lovable
       2. `SingleSignOnService Location` : use as SAML SSO URL in Lovable
       3. `Certificate (X.509)` : paste into Lovable

    <Note>
      Lovable does not support IdP‑initiated SAML. Launching from the Okta app tile will not work; start the sign‑in from Lovable (SP‑initiated).
    </Note>
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Auth0

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="OIDC">
    1. In Auth0, create an application: Dashboard → Applications → Applications → Create Application → Regular Web Application.

       - `Domain` (Issuer URL)
       - `Client ID`
       - `Client Secret`

    <Note>
      No additional configuration is required beyond the callback URL. Use your Auth0 Domain as the Issuer URL in Lovable.
    </Note>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SAML">
    1. In Auth0, **create app and enable SAML2 Add-on**: Auth0 Dashboard → Applications → Create Application → Regular Web Application → Create → Add-ons → enable SAML2 Web App.

       - In Settings, set `Application Callback URL (ACS)`  to `https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler`
       - Paste the **Settings Map** JSON shown below into **SAML2 Add-on** settings:

    ```json
        {
          "mappings": {
            "email": "http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier"
          },
          "nameIdentifierFormat": "urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:emailAddress"
        }
    ```

    3. **Save**
    3. **Copy values from Add-on panel and add them in Lovable** → Settings → Workspace → Identity (SAML 2.0):
       - `Issuer`  → Auth0 Issuer
       - `SAML Protocol URL`  → SAML Protocol URL
       - `Certificate` (X.509) → X.509 certificate
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Microsoft Entra ID SSO (SAML)

To connect Microsoft Entra ID to Lovable, follow the steps below:

1. **Enterprise application**: Microsoft Entra ID → Enterprise applications → New application → Create your own application → Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery.
2. **SSO settings:**
   1. Reply URL (ACS): `https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler`
   2. Identifier (Entity ID): : a unique value (can be the same ACS URL)
1. **Users and groups**: Assign users/groups who should have access.
2. **Configure it in Lovable**. From the SAML single sign-on page:
   1. `Login URL`  → use as SAML SSO URL in Lovable
   2. `Identifier (Entity ID)`  → use as Issuer in Lovable
   3. `Certificate (Base64)` → paste into Lovable

<Note>
  Make sure to Map `email` to `user.mail`. If `user.mail` is empty, use `user.userprincipalname` .
</Note>

### OIDC Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid or mismatched Redirect URI">
    Ensure the redirect/callback URL exactly matches https://auth.lovable.dev/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/auth/handler in your IdP.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Issuer URL / discovery fails">
    Use the provider's OIDC Issuer URL (not just the domain). For Okta, copy from the Sign-on tab; for Auth0, use your tenant Domain.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email not returned">
    Grant the `email` scope and ensure the user account has a primary email.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Authorization flow issues">
    Use Authorization Code with a confidential client and client secret. Avoid implicit or PKCE-only app types.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### SAML Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Invalid ACS or Audience">
    Ensure both ACS and Audience/Entity ID exactly match https://auth.lovable.dev/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\_/auth/handler in your IdP.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Email claim missing">
    Map an email claim. For Microsoft Entra, use user.mail, falling back to user.userprincipalname if mail is empty.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="IdP-initiated SSO not supported">
    Launch SSO from Lovable. Starting from your IdP dashboard tile will not work.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Provider credentials invalid">
    Paste the correct X.509 certificate. If the certificate rotates, update it in Lovable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Common issues and troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I already have an account, but I'm joining a business workspace that uses SSO. How do I log in?">
    If you created your account using another login method (like email/password, Google, or GitHub), you'll need to log in that way **first**. Once you're logged in, navigate to Settings → Identity → Link with SSO. This will link your existing account to your SSO identity.

    <Note>
      **Important:** If you attempt to log in with SSO before linking your existing account, you'll see an error. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. Log in using your original method first to complete the linking process.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which SSO providers does Lovable support (Okta, Entra ID, Google SSO, etc.)?">
    Lovable supports **all SSO providers** that implement OIDC (OpenID Connect) or SAML protocols. This includes, but is not limited to: - Okta - Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) - Google Workspace - Auth0 - OneLogin - - Any other OIDC or SAML-compliant identity provider Since we support the industry-standard OIDC and SAML protocols, you can integrate with any SSO provider that supports these protocols.
