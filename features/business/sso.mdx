Single Sign-On (SSO) is available as a business feature in Lovable, enabling secure, centralized authentication across your organization.
With SSO, users can access all their tools with one set of credentials, simplifying access management and improving security.

Lovable supports both **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** and **SAML** protocols, enabling integration with all major identity providers including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Google Workspace, and more.

### Setup SSO

To set up SSO, a **Workspace Owner** or **Admin** must log in and navigate to  
**Settings → Workspace → Identity**, then follow the setup instructions.

## OIDC Configuration

For OIDC providers, configure the following settings:

**Redirect URI:**
https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler

**Required Scopes:**

- `email`
- `openid`

## SAML Configuration

For SAML providers, configure the following settings:

**Redirect URI / ACS URL:**
https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler

**Audience URI / Entity ID:**
https://auth.lovable.dev/__/auth/handler

**Required Claims:**
Make sure the SAML response includes display_name and email as attributes.
These attributes are required for authentication and user provisioning in Lovable.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I already have an account, but I'm joining a business workspace that uses SSO. How do I log in?">
    If you created your account using another login method (like email/password,
    Google, or GitHub), you'll need to log in that way **first**. Once you're
    logged in, navigate to Settings → Identity → Link with SSO. This will link
    your existing account to your SSO identity.
    <Note>
      **Important:** If you attempt to log in with SSO before linking your
      existing account, you'll see an error. This is a security measure to
      prevent unauthorized access. Log in using your original method first to
      complete the linking process.
