Single Sign-On (SSO) is available for **Business plan and above**, enabling secure, centralized authentication across your organization. With SSO, users can access all their tools with one set of credentials, simplifying access management and improving security.

Lovable supports both **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** and **SAML** protocols, enabling integration with all major identity providers including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Google Workspace, and more.

### Setup SSO

To set up SSO, a **Workspace Owner** or **Admin** must log in and navigate to\
**Settings → Workspace → Identity**, then follow the setup instructions.

## OIDC Configuration

For OIDC providers, configure the following settings:

**Redirect URI:** https://auth.lovable.dev/\_\_/auth/handler

**Required Scopes:**

- `email`
- `openid`

## SAML Configuration

For SAML providers, configure the following settings:

**Redirect URI / ACS URL:** https://auth.lovable.dev/\_\_/auth/handler

**Audience URI / Entity ID:** https://auth.lovable.dev/\_\_/auth/handler

**Required Claims:** Make sure the SAML response includes display_name and email as attributes. These attributes are required for authentication and user provisioning in Lovable.

### Common Issues and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I already have an account, but I'm joining a business workspace that uses SSO. How do I log in?">
    If you created your account using another login method (like email/password, Google, or GitHub), you'll need to log in that way **first**. Once you're logged in, navigate to Settings → Identity → Link with SSO. This will link your existing account to your SSO identity.

    <Note>
      **Important:** If you attempt to log in with SSO before linking your existing account, you'll see an error. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. Log in using your original method first to complete the linking process.
