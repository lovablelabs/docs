Single Sign-On (SSO) is available for **Business plan and above**, enabling secure, centralized authentication across your organization. With SSO, users can access all their tools with one set of credentials, simplifying access management and improving security.

Lovable supports both **OIDC (OpenID Connect)** and **SAML** protocols, enabling integration with all major identity providers including Okta, Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD), Google Workspace, and more.

### Setup SSO

To set up SSO, a **Workspace Owner** or **Admin** must log in and navigate to\
**Settings → Workspace → Identity**, then follow the setup instructions.

<Note>
  SSO is available on **Business** and **Enterprise** plans. The Identity tab is visible only on these plans.
</Note>

## Choose your protocol

Pick the protocol used by your identity provider:

### Common issues and troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I already have an account, but I'm joining a business workspace that uses SSO. How do I log in?">
    If you created your account using another login method (like email/password, Google, or GitHub), you'll need to log in that way **first**. Once you're logged in, navigate to Settings → Identity → Link with SSO. This will link your existing account to your SSO identity.

    <Note>
      **Important:** If you attempt to log in with SSO before linking your existing account, you'll see an error. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access. Log in using your original method first to complete the linking process.
