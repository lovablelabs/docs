Lovable lets you connect your own domain or subdomain to your published project, so visitors can access it from a custom URL instead of the default `xxx.lovable.app` project URL.

Connecting a custom domain improves your site's:

- **Brand identity** - looks more professional
- **Search engine visibility** - better SEO
- **Memorability** - easier to share and remember

## Prerequisites

To connect a custom domain, ensure that:

- You are on a paid Lovable plan.
- Your project is **published**. You cannot connect a domain to an unpublished project.
- You own a domain name. See [full list of supported providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list) where you can purchase a domain.
- You have **access to the DNS settings** for the domain or subdomain you want to connect. If you cannot modify DNS records for your domain, you won’t be able to verify ownership and connect it.

## Connect a custom domain

Only verified owners can use a custom domain with their project:

- Every domain connection requires ownership verification.
- Domains from deleted projects can be reclaimed by verifying ownership.

Lovable uses a tool called Entri to help you connect your domain quickly and securely. For some providers it offers an automatic DNS setup.

You can connect a domain from two locations:

- **Project → Settings → Domains**
- **Publish modal → Custom domain** (can be done after publishing your project)

Follow the steps below to connect a custom domain:

1. Click **Connect domain**.
2. Enter your domain or subdomain (for example, `yourdomain.com` or `blog.yourdomain.com`), click **Connect domain**, then click **Continue**.

   <Info>
     When adding a domain, Lovable does not automatically add the `www` subdomain. You can add it separately if you want both.
   </Info>
4. Now, you can connect your domain in two ways:
   - **Automatic setup with Entri**: Select your domain provider from the list, log in, and authorize access for Entri to update your DNS records. This includes a TXT record to verify ownership.
   - **Manual setup**: If your DNS provider is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the **Select your domain provider** modal and choose **Go to our manual setup**. Copy the A record and TXT record and input them directly into your domain registrar.
4. Click **Done**. Wait for verification and SSL certificate to be issued. When complete, the domain will become **Live** and your Lovable app will be live at your custom domain.

<Info>
  DNS changes may take up to **72 hours to propagate**, though most updates are live within a few hours.
</Info>

## Domain statuses

Domains have clear statuses that indicate the current state and required user action.

| Status              | Description                                                                                                                         | User action                                                                   |

| **Failed**          | Ownership verified, but SSL certificate could not be provisioned.                                                                   | Click **Retry** to attempt again.                                             |
| **Live**            | Domain is live and serving your project.                                                                                            | No action required.                                                           |

| **Removed**         | Domain was removed because it was added to another project.                                                                         | Reconnect if needed.                                                          |

You can remove a domain at any point regardless of its status.

## Primary domain

Lovable allows you to mark **one domain as the primary domain**.

- The domain status must be **Live** in order to mark it as primary. Click the three dots menu  next to your domain and click **Set as primary**.
- The first domain added to a project automatically becomes primary (applies to domains added after 29 October 2025)
- If a domain is primary, all other domains redirect to it.
- You can unset the primary domain; in that case, all connected domains serve the project equally. Click the three dots menu next to your primary domain and click **Unset as primary**.

## FAQ

  <Accordion title="My custom domain is connected, but my site isn't live. What should I do?">
    - Double-check your DNS settings by using for example [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php). Sometimes DNS changes can take up to 72 hours to propagate. Correct DNS settings should be:
      - A record pointing to 185.158.133.1 for @ as host name.
      - A record pointing to 185.158.133.1 for www as host name.
    - Clear your browser cache or test in an incognito window.
    - Try removing and re-adding the domain in **Project → Settings → Domains**.
