A **custom domain** lets you use your own domain or subdomain for your published Lovable project. When you connect a custom domain, visitors can access your app using a branded URL instead of the default `xxx.lovable.app` project URL.

Connecting a custom domain improves your site's:

- **Brand identity** - look more trustworthy and professional
- **Search engine visibility** - better SEO and discoverability
- **Memorability** - easier for users to share and remember

## Prerequisites

To connect a custom domain, ensure that:

- You are on a paid Lovable plan.
- Your project is published. See [Publish your app](/features/publish) for more information.
- You own a domain name. You can **purchase one directly within Lovable** (through IONOS).
- You have **access to the DNS settings** for the domain or subdomain you want to connect. **Ownership verification** requires adding DNS `A` and `TXT` records provided by Lovable during setup.

## Connect a custom domain

You can connect a domain to your published Lovable project using **automatic** setup (powered by Entri) or **manual** DNS configuration. Both methods require verifying ownership of your domain.

You can connect a domain from two locations:

- **Project → Settings → Domains**
- **Publish modal → Custom domain** (can be done after publishing your project)

Follow the steps below to connect a custom domain:

1. Click **Connect domain**.
2. Enter your domain or subdomain (for example, `yourdomain.com` or `blog.yourdomain.com`), click **Connect domain**, then click **Continue**.

   <Info>
     When adding a domain, Lovable does not automatically add the `www` subdomain. You can add it separately if you want both.
   </Info>
3. Now, you can connect your domain in two ways:
   - **Automatic setup with Entri**: Select your domain provider from the list, log in, and authorize Entri to update your DNS records.
   - **Manual setup**: If your DNS provider is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the **Select your domain provider** modal and choose **Go to our manual setup**. Copy the `A` record and `TXT` record and input them directly into your domain registrar.
4. Click **Done**. Wait for verification and SSL certificate to be issued. When complete, the domain will become **Live** and your Lovable app will be live at your custom domain.

<Info>
  DNS changes may take up to **72 hours to propagate**, though most updates are live within a few hours.
</Info>

## Domain statuses

Domains have clear statuses that reflect verification progress, DNS propagation, SSL certificate readiness, and required user action.

| Status               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | User action                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

| **Ready**            | The domain is ready but the project was unpublished. When published again, the status automatically becomes **Live**.                                                                                                                             | Publish the project.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

You can remove a domain at any point regardless of its status.

## Primary domain

Lovable allows you to set **one domain as the primary domain**.

- The domain status must be **Live** in order to mark it as primary. Click the three dots menu next to your domain and click **Set as primary**.
- The first custom domain you add to a project automatically becomes the primary domain (for domains added after October 29, 2025).
- If a domain is primary, all other domains redirect to it.
- Only one domain can be primary at a time.
- You can unset the primary domain; in that case, all connected domains serve the project equally. Click the three dots menu next to your primary domain and click **Unset as primary**.
