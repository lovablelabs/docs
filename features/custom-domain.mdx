Lovable makes it easy to [publish](/features/deploy) your project to the web, either on a free lovable staging subdomain (e.g. yoursite.lovable.app) or your own custom domain.
This guide walks you through how to connect your domain, troubleshoot common issues, and understand your options across different hosting providers.

## Why use a custom domain

Connecting a custom domain (e.g., yourdomain.com) improves your site's:

- **Brand identity** - looks more professional
- **Search engine visibility** - better SEO
- **Memorability** - easier to share and remember

## Requirements to use a custom domain

Before you begin:

- You must be on a paid Lovable plan.
- You need to own a domain name. For easier setup, you can purchase one from providers like:
  - [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com)
  - [GoDaddy](https://www.godaddy.com)
  - [Full list of supported providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list)

Lovable uses a tool called Entri to help you connect your domain quickly and securely. For some providers it offers an automatic DNS setup and www redirect.

## Connect your domain (via Entri)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open your Project Settings">
    Go to Project \> Settings \> Domains and click Connect Domain.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue Setup">
    Click Continue and enter your domain (e.g., yourdomain.com).

  <Step title="Select Your DNS Provider">
    Choose your domain provider from the list. If your provider isn’t listed, please see the steps listed further down on this page.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Authorize with Entri">
    Follow the prompts to log in to your provider and authorize access for Entri to update your DNS settings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Close and Complete">
    Click Close Window, return to Lovable, and click Done.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  DNS changes may take up to **48 hours to propagate**, though most updates are live within a few hours.
</Warning>

All set\! Once verified, your Lovable app will be live at your custom domain.

### What if my provider isn't listed?

If your provider isn’t supported by Entri, you can still connect your domain manually.

1. Open your Project Settings and go to Project \> Settings \> Domains and click Connect Domain.
2. Enter your domain and continue.
3. When choosing a provider, scroll to the bottom and choose a manual setup.
   From there you’ll be able to copy the records to input directly into your domain registrar.

## Hosting on Third-Party Platforms

You can also deploy your Lovable app using GitHub and host it on platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or using GitHub Pages with providers like Namecheap.

### Netlify

1. Transfer your project to GitHub.
2. Import it into Netlify and deploy.
3. Add a domain in Netlify by going to Domain Management.
4. Follow DNS instructions in Netlify to connect your custom domain.
5. Done\! Your site redeploys automatically when changes are made in Lovable.

### Vercel

1. Create a GitHub repo from Lovable.
2. Import into Vercel and assign your custom domain.
3. Create a development branch for staging.
4. Set Vercel to only deploy from the main branch.
5. Switch in Lovable to the development branch. Now you can make changes without them directly going live to production.
6. Deploy changes to production when ready by merging dev → main.

### Namecheap \+ GitHub Pages
