Lovable lets you connect your own custom domain or subdomain to your published project. This allows visitors to access your app from a branded URL instead of the default `xxx.lovable.app` project URL.

Connecting a custom domain improves your site's:

- **Brand identity** - looks more professional
- **Search engine visibility** - better SEO
- **Memorability** - easier to share and remember

## Prerequisites

To connect a custom domain, ensure that:

- You are on a paid Lovable plan.
- Your project is published. See [Publish your app](/features/publish) for more information.
- You own a domain name. See [full list of supported providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list) where you can purchase a domain.
- You have **access to the DNS settings** for the domain or subdomain you want to connect. **Ownership verification** happens by adding DNS records (A and TXT records) provided by Lovable during setup.

## Connect a custom domain

You can connect a domain to your published Lovable project using automatic setup (using a tool called Entri) or manual DNS configuration. Both methods require verifying ownership of your domain.

You can connect a domain from two locations:

- **Project → Settings → Domains**
- **Publish modal → Custom domain** (can be done after publishing your project)

Follow the steps below to connect a custom domain:

1. Click **Connect domain**.
2. Enter your domain or subdomain (for example, `yourdomain.com` or `blog.yourdomain.com`), click **Connect domain**, then click **Continue**.

   <Info>
     When adding a domain, Lovable does not automatically add the `www` subdomain. You can add it separately if you want both.
   </Info>
4. Now, you can connect your domain in two ways:
   - **Automatic setup with Entri**: Select your domain provider from the list, log in, and authorize Entri to update your DNS records.
   - **Manual setup**: If your DNS provider is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the **Select your domain provider** modal and choose **Go to our manual setup**. Copy the A record and TXT record and input them directly into your domain registrar.
4. Click **Done**. Wait for verification and SSL certificate to be issued. When complete, the domain will become **Live** and your Lovable app will be live at your custom domain.

<Info>
  DNS changes may take up to **72 hours to propagate**, though most updates are live within a few hours.
</Info>

## Domain statuses

Domains have clear statuses that indicate the current state and required user action.

| Status              | Description                                                                                                           | User action                                                                   |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unpublished**     | Shown only for your `xxx.lovable.app` project URL when the project is not yet published.                              | Publish the project.                                                          |
| **Ready**           | The domain is ready but the project was unpublished. When published again, the status automatically becomes **Live**. | Publish the project.                                                          |
| **Action required** | The custom domain setup was not completed.                                                                            | Click **Complete setup** to finish connecting.                                |
| **Verifying**       | Waiting for DNS records to propagate.                                                                                 | Wait; no action required.                                                     |
| **Setting up**      | Verification complete; SSL certificates being issued.                                                                 | No action required; domain will automatically move to **Live** or **Failed.** |
| **Failed**          | Ownership verified, but SSL certificate could not be provisioned.                                                     | Click **Retry** to attempt again.                                             |
| **Live**            | Domain is live and serving your project.                                                                              | No action required.                                                           |
| **Offline**         | Domain was **Live** but DNS records are no longer valid.                                                              | Review displayed DNS records and fix them with your DNS provider.             |
| **Removed**         | Domain was removed because it was added to another project.                                                           | Reconnect if needed.                                                          |

You can remove a domain at any point regardless of its status.

## Primary domain

Lovable allows you to set **one domain as the primary domain**.

- The domain status must be **Live** in order to mark it as primary. Click the three dots menu next to your domain and click **Set as primary**.
- The first custom domain you add to a project automatically becomes the primary domain (for domains added after October 29, 2025).
- If a domain is primary, all other domains redirect to it.
- Only one domain can be primary at a time.
- You can unset the primary domain; in that case, all connected domains serve the project equally. Click the three dots menu next to your primary domain and click **Unset as primary**.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My custom domain is connected, but my site isn't live. What should I do?">
    - Double-check your DNS settings by using for example [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php). Sometimes DNS changes can take up to 72 hours to propagate. Correct DNS settings should be:
      - A record pointing to 185.158.133.1 for @ as host name.
      - A record pointing to 185.158.133.1 for www as host name.
    - Clear your browser cache or test in an incognito window.
    - Try removing and re-adding the domain in **Project → Settings → Domains**.
