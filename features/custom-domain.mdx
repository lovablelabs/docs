Lovable lets you connect your own domain or subdomain to your published project, so visitors can access it via a custom URL instead of the default `xxx.lovable.app` address.

Using a custom domain can make your project feel more professional, memorable, and brand-consistent.

## Why use a custom domain

Connecting a custom domain improves your site's:

- **Brand identity** - looks more professional
- **Search engine visibility** - better SEO
- **Memorability** - easier to share and remember

## Prerequisites

To connect a custom domain, ensure that:

- You are on a paid Lovable plan.
- Your project is **published**. You cannot connect a domain to an unpublished project.
- You own a domain name. See [full list of supported providers](https://developers.entri.com/provider-list) where you can purchase a domain.
- You have **access to the DNS settings** for the domain or subdomain you want to connect. If you cannot modify DNS records for your domain, you won’t be able to verify ownership and connect it.

Lovable uses a tool called Entri to help you connect your domain quickly and securely. For some providers it offers an automatic DNS setup.

## Connect a custom domain

You can connect a domain via two locations:

- **Settings → Domains**
- **Publish modal → Custom domain** (after publishing your project)

Follow the steps below to connect a custom domain:

1. Click **Connect domain**.
2. Enter your domain or subdomain (for example, `example.com` or `blog.example.com`), click **Connect domain**, then click **Continue**.
4. Now you can connect your domain in two ways:
   - **Automatic setup with Entri**: Select your domain provider from the list, log in, and authorize access for Entri to update your DNS records. This includes a TXT record to verify ownership.
   - **Manual setup**: If your DNS provider is not listed, scroll to the bottom of the **Select your domain provider** modal and choose **Go to our manual setup**. Copy the A-records and TXT-records and input them directly into your domain registrar.
4. Click **Done**. Wait for verification and SSL certificate issuance. Once complete, the domain will become **Live** and your Lovable app will be live at your custom domain.

<Info>
  DNS changes may take up to **72 hours to propagate**, though most updates are live within a few hours.
</Info>

When adding a root domain (like `example.com`), Lovable does not automatically add the `www` subdomain. You can add it separately if you want both.

## Domain statuses

Custom domains have clear **statuses** that indicate the current state and required user action.

| Status              | Description                                                                                     | User action                                                                   |
| :------------------ | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unpublished**     | Shown only for your `xxx.lovable.app` subdomain when the project is not yet published.          | Publish the project.                                                          |
| **Ready**           | The domain is ready but the project is not yet published. Will move to **Live** when published. | Publish the project.                                                          |
| **Action required** | The custom domain setup was not completed.                                                      | Click **Complete setup** to finish connecting.                                |
| **Verifying**       | Waiting for DNS records to propagate.                                                           | Wait; no action required.                                                     |
| **Setting up**      | Verification complete; SSL certificates being issued.                                           | No action required; domain will automatically move to **Live** or **Failed.** |
| **Offline**         | Domain was **Live** but DNS records are no longer valid.                                        | Review displayed DNS records and fix them with your DNS provider.             |
| **Failed**          | Ownership verified, but SSL certificate could not be provisioned.                               | Click **Retry** to attempt again.                                             |
| **Removed**         | Domain was automatically removed (for example, added to another project).                       | Reconnect if needed.                                                          |
| **Live**            | Domain is live and serving your project.                                                        | No action required                                                            |

  <Accordion title="My custom domain is connected, but my site isn't live. What should I do?">
    - Double-check your DNS settings by using for example [dnschecker.org](https://dnschecker.org/all-dns-records-of-domain.php). Sometimes DNS changes can take up to 48 hours to propagate. Correct DNS settings should be:
      - A record pointing to 185.158.133.1 for @ as host name.
      - A record pointing to 185.158.133.1 for www as host name.
    - Clear your browser cache or test in an incognito window.
    - Try removing and re-adding the domain in Project \> Settings \> Domains.
