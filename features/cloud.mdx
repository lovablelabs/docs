Lovable Cloud gives you everything you need to launch and run your ideas—databases, storage, sign-ups and logins, global delivery, and more—all built in and working together from the start.  

Every workspace gets **$100 of free usage each month**, enough to keep several projects running at once. That allowance can cover:  

- A personal blog or portfolio  
- A dashboard for your team  
- An app with accounts and logins for thousands of users  
- A marketing site handling tens of thousands of visitors  

Or, in many cases, all of these running side by side—without paying a cent.  

As your projects grow, Lovable Cloud scales with you—without adding complexity. No knobs to turn, no fine print to untangle. Just a single clear cost and apps that keep running.  

And you’re always in control:  
- Keep it free with a built-in cap, so you’ll never face surprise charges.  
- Or switch on pay-as-you-go to let your projects grow seamlessly, with optional budget limits for peace of mind.  

Lovable Cloud is about clarity and confidence: the fastest way to go from idea to live product, without ever worrying about the infrastructure underneath.  

<Note>  
Lovable Cloud is currently in **beta**. During this period, you will not be charged for usage—even if you exceed the free $100 monthly allowance. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test, and grow your projects without cost while we gather feedback and refine the service.

## Getting Started  

To use Lovable Cloud, simply select **“Lovable Cloud”** when starting a new project from the dashboard. Then describe a feature you need—like user authentication, file uploads, or connecting to an external API—and Lovable will generate it for you.  

Once created, you can view and manage everything in the **Backend** section of your project settings.  

<Note>  
You don’t need to think about what’s “frontend” or “backend.” Just describe what you want, and Lovable builds the full experience for you.

## Features  

- **Database** — View tables and edit data  
- **Auth** — Configure how users sign in to your app  
- **Secrets** — Store and manage environment variables (like API keys) securely  
- **Suggestions** — Get security and performance recommendations  
- **Storage** — Upload and manage files, images, and documents  
- **Users** — View user data and track new signups  
- **Logs** — Monitor application logs to debug issues

## Example Flow  

1. You ask the AI to add authentication so users can log in.  
   → Lovable adds the functionality, and you manage it through **Auth** in the Backend tab.  

2. Next, you ask for file uploads.  
   → Lovable sets up storage, and you can see and manage uploads in the **Storage** section.  

3. Finally, you want to integrate an external API to analyze your data.  
   → Lovable prompts you for an API key, which is stored securely in **Secrets** so no one else can access it.  

Through each step, Lovable Cloud automatically handles the underlying setup, so you can focus on building the experience you want—not wiring together infrastructure.

## FAQs  

### I'm currently using the Supabase integration. What does this change mean for me?  
Nothing changes for your existing projects. Your Supabase integration will continue to work exactly as it does today, and we will continue to support it.  

Lovable Cloud is our new, fully integrated solution, designed to offer an even more seamless, all-in-one experience on our platform.  

Going forward, you'll have a choice:  
- For existing projects: continue using Supabase with no changes.  
- For new projects: choose either Lovable Cloud or Supabase.  

Our goal is to give you more power and flexibility. You can stick with your current setup or explore the benefits of Lovable Cloud whenever you’re ready.

### What affects my Lovable Cloud costs?  
Your costs are based on how much your apps are used—similar to a phone plan, you only pay beyond the free allowance.  

Two main factors influence this:  
- **How busy your app is**: More users, more activity, more interactions, more resources used.  
- **How much data your app transfers**: Apps with large uploads/downloads (like images or videos) use more data than simple text-based tools.  

The big picture: your costs scale with your app’s success. You start free, and only pay as your projects grow.

### What does the monthly free usage include?  
Every workspace gets $100 in free Cloud usage per month. That’s typically enough to run several personal or mid-sized projects, such as:  

- A blog or portfolio  
- A team dashboard or internal tool  
- A web app with accounts and logins for thousands of users  
- A marketing site with tens of thousands of visitors  

In many cases, you can run all of these at the same time without paying anything.  

We’ll notify you as you get close to the limit. You can then choose to:  
- Stay free with a hard cap  
- Or enable pay-as-you-go for uninterrupted scaling

### Do I have full control over my monthly expenses?  
Yes. We designed Lovable Cloud to give you complete control:  

- **Option 1: Hard Budget (Zero Charges)**  
Stay strictly within the free allowance. If you go over, your projects pause automatically—so your bill stays $0.  

- **Option 2: Pay-As-You-Go (Seamless Scaling)**  
Enable pay-as-you-go on any paid plan. Your apps scale without interruption, and you only pay for usage beyond the free allowance. You can also set a monthly budget limit (e.g. $50). If you reach it, projects pause automatically—so you get growth with safety.
