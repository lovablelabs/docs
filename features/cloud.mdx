Cloud is Lovable's fully integrated backend, allowing you to manage everything from data and users to authentication, API keys, and file uploads, all within the platform, making it easier than ever to build and manage full-stack applications.

<Note>
  A full-stack project includes both the frontend (what your users see and interact with, like buttons, images, and text) and the backend (the behind-the-scenes system that stores data, handles API keys, logins, etc.).

  With Lovable, you don’t have to worry about any of the complex tech. Just describe what you want, and we’ll build both parts for you, automatically.
</Note>

- **Scales as you grow**\
  From your first launch to serving millions, Lovable Cloud expands seamlessly with your application.
- **Secure by default**\
  With enterprise-grade authentication, granular access controls, and best-practice compliance, Lovable Cloud protects your data without extra effort.
- **Fully portable **\
  Your app stays yours. Export your data anytime, self-host, or run independently with ease. Lovable Cloud is built on Supabase’s open-source foundation, giving you true portability and freedom, without lock-in.

### How do I use Lovable Cloud?

Cloud will automatically be enable once the agent detects a feature that requires backend functionality, such as user authentication, uploading files, or integrating an external API. 

You can also enable it manually, by clicking on the "Cloud" tab and selecting "Enable Lovable Cloud". 

Once enabled, you will be able to view and manage all backend data and settings in the "Cloud" section of your project.

### Features

All of these features live inside the **Cloud tab** in your Lovable project. 

#### Database

View, edit, and manage the tables that power your app—like `profiles` or `todos`. Quickly inspect records, make updates, and keep your data organized without needing SQL.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → Database_**

#### Users & Auth

See who’s signing up, manage user profiles, and configure how people log in—email, social sign-ins, or SSO. Everything about your users, all in one spot.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → Users_**

#### Storage

Upload and manage files, images, and documents—from product photos to user-generated content. Lovable Cloud keeps them secure and easy to serve.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → Storage_**

#### Edge Functions

Deploy custom logic that connects to APIs, automates workflows, or powers advanced features—without managing servers. Scales instantly with your traffic.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → Edge Functions_**

#### Built-in AI

Add powerful AI features like chat, summarization, or recommendations—without extra accounts, setup, or API keys. Intelligence, built right in.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → AI_**

#### Secrets

Securely store and manage environment variables such as API keys or tokens. Keep sensitive data safe while making development easier.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → Secrets_**

#### Logs

Monitor your app’s activity in real time. Use logs to debug issues, track events, and ensure everything is running smoothly.\
_Find it in _**_Cloud → Logs_**

### Example flow

1. You ask the AI to add authentication to your application, to enable users to log in to your application.
2. The AI adds the functionality, and you can manage it through the Auth feature in the "Backend" tab. You can change things like sign-in methods, or if a confirmation email is needed when signing up.
3. Then you move on and ask the AI to implement functionality to be able to add comments to your application. This will be implemented through tables, that you can find in the "Database" tab. Here you can see all comments created and their corresponding data.
4. Next, you ask for file uploads. Lovable sets up storage, and you can see and manage uploads in the Storage section.

### Pricing

<Note>
  Lovable Cloud is currently in **beta**. During this period, you will not be charged for usage, even if you exceed the free \$25 monthly allowance. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test, and grow your projects without cost while we gather feedback and refine the service.
</Note>

Your costs are based on how much your apps are used. Two main factors influence this:

- How busy your app is: More users, more activity, more interactions, more resources used.
- How much data your app transfers: Apps with large uploads/downloads (like images or videos) use more data than simple text-based tools.

Every workspace gets **\$25 of free usage each month**, enough to keep multiple projects running. After that you have the choice to:

- Keep it free with a built-in cap, so you’ll never face surprise charges.
- Or turn on auto top-up to let your projects grow seamlessly, with optional budget limits for peace of mind.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I’m currently using the Supabase integration. What does this change mean for me?">
    Don’t worry, nothing changes for your existing projects. Your Supabase integration will continue to work exactly as it does today, and we will continue to support it.

    - For existing projects: continue using Supabase with no changes.
    - For new projects: choose either Lovable Cloud or Supabase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I have full control over my monthly expenses?">
    Yes. We designed Lovable Cloud to give you complete control:

    - **Option 1: Hard Budget (Zero Charges)**
      Stay strictly within the free allowance. If you go over, your projects pause automatically. Your bill stays at \$0.
    - **Option 2: Auto Top-Up (Seamless Scaling)**\
      Enable auto top-up on any paid plan. Your apps scale without interruption, and you only pay for usage beyond the free allowance. You can also set a monthly budget limit (e.g. \$50). If you reach it, projects pause automatically.
    - **Option 3: Top-Up Manually (Controlled Scaling)**\
      Top-up your workspace balance with an amount you choose. Your apps scale, and you only pay for usage beyond the free allowance. If you spend your workspace balance, you will receive a notification and your projects will pause automatically.
