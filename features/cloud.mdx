Lovable now provides built-in database and AI connections, so you can build complex apps seamlessly. 
This makes Lovable even more accessible, empowering and fast-to-use than ever before and removes moments of friction and frustration in the development flow. 

## Cloud 

Lovable includes a fully integrated backend, allowing you to manage everything from data and users to authentication, API keys, and file uploads, all within the platform.
There’s no need for external tools or configurations. Our seamless backend system gives you complete control directly through the Lovable interface, making it easier than ever to build and manage full-stack applications.

<Note>
A full-stack project includes both the frontend (what your users see and interact with, like buttons, images, and text) and the backend (the behind-the-scenes system that stores data, handles API keys, logins, etc.).

With Lovable, you don’t have to worry about any of the complex tech. Just describe what you want, and we’ll build both parts for you, automatically.

</Note>

- **Scales as You Grow**  
From your first launch to serving millions, Lovable Cloud expands seamlessly with your application.
    
- **Secure by Default**  
With enterprise-grade authentication, granular access controls, and best-practice compliance, Lovable Cloud protects your data without extra effort.
    
- **Portable & Flexible**  
Your app stays yours. Export your data anytime, self-host, or run independently with ease. Lovable Cloud is built on Supabase’s open-source foundation, giving you true portability and freedom, without lock-in.

### How do I use Lovable Cloud?
To use Lovable Cloud simply start building. Then, describe a feature that requires backend functionality, such as user authentication, uploading files, or integrating an external API, and Lovable will handle the rest. 
Once generated, you can view and manage all backend data and settings in the "Cloud" section of your project.

### Features
- **Database** View tables and edit data stored in your app. 
- **Storage** Upload and manage files, images, and documents
- **Users** View user data and track new user signups
- **Auth** Configure how users sign in to your app
- **Edge functions** Deploy edge functions to handle complex business logic with real-time analytics.
- **Secrets** Store and manage environment variables such as API keys securely
- **Logs** Monitor application logs to debug issues

### Example flow

1. You ask the AI to add authentication to your application, to enable users to log in to your application.
The AI adds the functionality, and you can manage it through the Auth feature in the "Backend" tab. 
You can change things like sign-in methods, or if a confirmation email is needed when signing up.

2. Then you move on and ask the AI to implement functionality to be able to upload comments to your application.
This will be implemented through tables, that you can find in the "Database" tab.
Here you can see all comments created and their corresponding data.

3. Next, you ask for file uploads. Lovable sets up storage, and you can see and manage uploads in the Storage section.

### Pricing

<Note>  
Lovable Cloud is currently in **beta**. During this period, you will not be charged for usage, even if you exceed the free $25 monthly allowance. This gives you the freedom to experiment, test, and grow your projects without cost while we gather feedback and refine the service.
</Note>  

Your costs are based on how much your apps are used. Two main factors influence this:
- How busy your app is: More users, more activity, more interactions, more resources used.
- How much data your app transfers: Apps with large uploads/downloads (like images or videos) use more data than simple text-based tools.

Every workspace gets **$25 of free usage each month**, enough to keep multiple projects running. After that you have the choice to: 
- Keep it free with a built-in cap, so you’ll never face surprise charges.  
- Or turn on auto top-up to let your projects grow seamlessly, with optional budget limits for peace of mind.

## AI

Lovable AI makes it simple to bring powerful AI features into your app. No extra accounts, no setup. Start for free and then pay-as-you go based on usage. 
Simply ask Lovable to set up a feature that will need AI, and Lovable will handle the rest. 

### Example use-cases
    - AI summaries
    - AI chat bot
    - Sentiment detection
    - Creative generation like brainstorming or copy drafting
    - Multilingual translation

### Example flow

Decide what you want the AI to do. Keep it simple and clear.  

``` Wrap Example prompt for summaries wrap
Create a dashboard where I can input a message and get a summary of it. 
```

``` Wrap Example prompt for sentiment detection wrap
Create a dashboard that classifies customer reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
```

Lovable will now create the feature and everything surrounding it. AI functionality should work out of the box, without the need for an API key, as well as UI and backend logic

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="I’m currently using the Supabase integration. What does this change mean for me?">
        Don’t worry, nothing changes for your existing projects. Your Supabase integration will continue to work exactly as it does today, and we will continue to support it.
            - For existing projects: continue using Supabase with no changes.
            - For new projects: choose either Lovable Cloud or Supabase.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Do I have full control over my monthly expenses?">
        Yes. We designed Lovable Cloud to give you complete control:  
            - **Option 1: Hard Budget (Zero Charges)** 
            Stay strictly within the free allowance. If you go over, your projects pause automatically. Your bill stays at $0.  
            - **Option 2: Auto Top-Up (Seamless Scaling)**  
            Enable auto top-up on any paid plan. Your apps scale without interruption, and you only pay for usage beyond the free allowance. You can also set a monthly budget limit (e.g. $50). If you reach it, projects pause automatically.
            - **Option 3: Top-Up Manually (Controlled Scaling)**  
            Top-up your workspace balance with an amount you choose. Your apps scale, and you only pay for usage beyond the free allowance. If you spend your workspace balance, you will receive a notification and your projects will pause automatically.
