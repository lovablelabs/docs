## **GitHub Branch Switching**

Select the branch to make edits to in your GitHub repository. To switch branches in GitHub through the Lovable editor:

1. Enter your project.
2. Go to Project Settings
3. Go to GitHub
4. Click the branch dropdown, and choose the branch you want to switch to.

<Warning>
  ### **Important Notes:**

  - Commit or stash any uncommitted changes before switching branches
  - If you encounter "Branch not found" errors, pull the latest changes from the remote repository first
  - If you can't switch branches, check if you have untracked files that would be overwritten
  - Branch switching will change all files in your workspace to match that branch
  - Lovable primarily syncs with your repository's default branch (usually main)
</Warning>

<Note>
  If you need to work with a different branch as your primary branch, you can change the default branch in your GitHub repository settings.
