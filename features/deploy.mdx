Once your web app is ready, you can **deploy it** and share it with the world. You also have the option to **share a work-in-progress version** to gather feedback before going live. Lovable makes it simple to publish, iterate, and distribute your applications with just a few clicks.

<Tip>
  Your published app will be accessible to anyone with the link. Make sure
  you're ready to share before publishing!
</Tip>

## Publishing your app

When your project is ready, **publish it to generate a shareable URL.** This makes it easy to showcase your application or share it with collaborators and stakeholders.

      **Use previewing for iterative development**

      Previewing is very handy as it allows you and others to view the latest changes without affecting the live, published version of your application.

      We've noticed users using it for iterative development and getting real-time feedback, as well as for collaborative reviews and testing before final deployment.

    To preview:

    1. Open the **Share** dialog.

    2. Locate the **Preview** section.

## Launch & Get Traffic

![](/images/LovableLaunchedfromFigma.png)

Launching a product is exciting—but getting people to actually use it? That’s the real challenge. Whether you’re rolling out a side project, a SaaS tool, or a community-driven app, your first 100 users set the foundation for everything that follows. This isn’t about magic hacks or vanity metrics. It’s about practical, low-cost strategies to get real users who care about what you’re building.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tap Into Existing Networks">
    Your first users are likely in communities you’re already part of—whether it’s a Slack group, a subreddit, or a personal Twitter following. Instead of spamming, be genuinely helpful and mention your product when relevant.

    ### Where to Start:

    * **Identify personal connections** (friends, colleagues, acquaintances) who might benefit from your product.

    * **Engage in online communities** relevant to your product's niche (e.g., Reddit, Indie Hackers, Discord groups).

    * **Participate** authentically, offering value before mentioning your product.

    * **Find relevant industry groups** in Slack, Twitch or Telegram and engage authentically.

    👉 \[Example] If you’re launching a dev tool, start by helping people in **r/webdev** or **r/programming** and mention your tool naturally when it fits.

    🧰 [Gummysearch](), [Casixty](), [Discord]()
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Validate Ideas and Continuously Test">
    Before going all in, **validate demand and optimize conversion rates**.

    ### Where to Start:

    * **Develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP)** to test with early users and gather feedback.

    * **Conduct A/B testing** on different aspects of your product and marketing strategies to determine what resonates best.

    * **Analyze data** to make informed decisions and iterate on your product or approach accordingly.

    👉 \[Example] A startup tested two landing pages: One focused on **features**, the other on **user pain points**. The pain-point-focused page had **3x better conversion.**

    🧰 [Lovable](), [PostHog](), [Plausible]()
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Content Marketing & SEO">
    People search for solutions every day. If you can create content that solves their problems, you’ll get users—organically.

    ### Where to Start:

    * Create **solution-focused content** (blog posts, tutorials, case studies) addressing your target audience's pain points.

    * **Optimize content** for long-tail keywords with low competition to improve search engine visibility.

    * **Repurpose content** into different formats (e.g., turning a blog post into a video or infographic) to reach a broader audience.

    👉 \[Example] If you’re launching a code deployment tool, write **“How to Deploy Your App in 3 Minutes”**, optimize it for search, and share it in dev communities.

    🧰 [BlogFox](), [ChatGPT](), [Ahrefs]()
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Plan and Execute a Strategic Launch">
    Platforms like **Product Hunt** and [**Lovable Launched**]() are goldmines for early adopters. They work best when you have a clear audience and a compelling launch message.

    ### Where to Start:

    * Prepare a **clear and concise landing page** that effectively communicates your product's value proposition.

    * **Engage with communities** on platforms like Product Hunt and Lovable Launched prior to your launch to build anticipation.

    * **Coordinate** a launch day plan, including announcements in relevant groups, mailing lists, and social media channels.

    👉 \[Example] A founder launched a simple AI-powered calendar tool and got **500+ upvotes** on Lovable Launched just by engaging with early adopters in startup circles beforehand.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Offer Incentives & Lead Magnets">
    People love free stuff—especially when it’s valuable. Lead magnets help you build an email list of potential users who actually care about your product.

    ### Where to Start:

    * **Develop valuable lead magnets** (e.g., free templates, eBooks) to encourage sign-ups.

    * Implement **referral programs** rewarding users for bringing in new customers.

    * Provide exclusive beta access or early-bird discounts to create **a sense of urgency** and exclusivity.

    👉 \[Example] Dropbox famously used a **double-sided referral program**, which helped them grow from **100K to 4M users in 15 months**.

    🧰 [Google Search Console]()
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use Social Media (the Right Way)">
    Posting about your launch once won’t cut it. Instead, create value-driven content that naturally attracts attention.

    ### Where to Start:

    * **Share engaging content** on platforms like Twitter, LinkedIn, TikTok, or Instagram, tailored to your audience. Use videos to showcase product use cases creatively.

    * **Interact** with followers by responding to comments and messages promptly.

    * **Join and contribute** to groups and discussions where your target audience is active.

    👉 \[Example] Instead of just tweeting "We launched!", share a story: **“We built this to solve \[problem]—here’s why it’s different.”**

    🧰 [Youtube](), [X, LinedIn]()
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Cold Outreach (When Done Right)">
    Reaching out to potential users directly can work—if you personalize it and avoid sounding salesy.

    ### Where to Start:

    * **Identify potential users** through platforms like LinkedIn, Twitter (X), or industry-specific forums.

    * Craft **personalized, short, non-spammy** messages that address specific needs or challenges of the recipient.

    * **Offer value upfront**, such as exclusive access or personalized demos, without being overly promotional.

    👉 \[Example] Instead of "Hey, check out my tool!", say **“I saw you posted about struggling with X. We built something that might help—want early access?”**

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Collaborate with Niche Influencers">
    Find micro-influencers who already talk to your target audience and partner with them.

    ### Where to Start:

    * **Research and identify micro-influencers** whose audience aligns with your target market. Look for YouTubers, bloggers, and Twitter creators in your space.

    * Propose **mutually beneficial partnerships**, such as offering free access in exchange for honest reviews or mentions.

    * Ensure collaborations are **authentic** and provide real value to the influencer's audience.

    * Sponsor content if budget allows (but focus on genuine partnerships).

    👉 \[Example] If you’re launching a design tool, partner with small UX YouTubers for an honest review.

  <Accordion title="Consider Paid Acquisition (As a Last Resort)">
    While organic methods are cost-effective and build a loyal user base, there might come a time when you consider paid acquisition to scale your efforts. However, it's essential to approach this cautiously to ensure a positive return on investment (ROI).

    ### **Where to Start:**

    * **Set a modest budget:** Begin with a small budget to test the waters without significant financial risk.

    * **Target specific audiences:** Use platforms like Google Ads or Facebook Ads to reach users who fit your ideal customer profile.

    * **Monitor and adjust:** Regularly track the performance of your ads. If certain campaigns aren't delivering results, tweak or discontinue them.

    * **Optimize landing pages:** Ensure that the pages users land on are compelling and relevant, increasing the chances of conversion.

    Remember, while paid acquisition can provide a quick influx of users, it's crucial to balance it with organic strategies to build a sustainable and engaged community.

    🧰 [Google Ads](), [Reddits Ads]()
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What’s next?">
    Congratulations on reaching your first milestone of acquiring 100 users! This achievement validates your MVP's value and its ability to address real user needs. Now, it's time to scale up. By continuously iterating and enhancing your product based on user feedback, the journey to your next 1,000 users will unfold naturally. Keep focusing on delivering value, and success will follow.
