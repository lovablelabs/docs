## FAQ and Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I publish my site?">
    If you get an error when publishing your site, it is most likely due to an unsurfaced build error causing the current version of your website not to function. Try troubleshooting the issue by asking the AI to investigate it. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my changes on the published version of my site?">
    To publish new changes to your live site you have to press **Update** in the publish dropdown. They don't get automatically pushed to your published project. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my published link?">
    To change your published link you have to rename your project. Go to the **Project settings** > **Rename**. For the renaming to update the link, make sure to press **Update** in the publish dropdown after the change. 
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I unpublish my project?">
Currently, there isn’t a way to unpublish a project. The only way to remove the public link is by deleting the project. As a workaround, you can remix the project to create an exact copy to continue working on, then delete the original.
