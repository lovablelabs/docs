Publishing turns your Lovable project into a live web app that you can share with others. Lovable makes it simple to go live — whether you’re sharing publicly or keeping your app private within your workspace.

- **Free and Pro plans:** Your published website is **public** and accessible to anyone with the link. You cannot restrict access on these plans, so make sure you're ready to share before publishing.
- **Business and Enterprise plans:** You can **control who can view your app** — either anyone with the link or only authenticated workspace members.

Once published, you can update your live app at any time and connect a custom domain for a polished, on-brand experience.

## Website access settings (Business and Enterprise plans)

On Business and Enterprise plans, you can manage who can view published apps to maintain privacy and control.

This enables you to:

- Build and share **internal apps** that stay private to your workspace.
- Prevent teammates from unintentionally publishing apps externally.
- Support governance and compliance for organizations that handle sensitive data.

Access can be managed at both the **workspace level** and **project level**.

### Workspace-level setting

Workspace **Admins** and **Owners** can set a default access policy for all published apps.

Go to **Workspace Settings → Default Website Access**

Choose one of:

- **Anyone with link can view:** All published apps are public by default and accessible to anyone.
- **Anyone in workspace can view:** All published apps are private by default and restricted to authenticated workspace members only. This ensures new apps stay private unless explicitly made public.

### Project-level setting

You can override the workspace default for individual projects.

When you click **Publish**, set **website access**  to:

- **Public – Anyone with link can view:** Accessible to anyone with the URL.
- **Private – Anyone in workspace can view:** Restricted to signed-in workspace members.

If you don’t change this, the project inherits the workspace default.

## Publishing your project

<Note>
  On Business and Enterprise plans, only workspace owners and admins can publish projects.
</Note>

1. In your project, click the **Publish** icon in the top-right corner.
2. In the **Publish** modal, review and configure:
   - **Website address**: by default, your app is published to `[project-url-slug].lovable.app`. You can edit the `[project-url-slug]`or add a [custom domain](/features/custom-domain) (available on paid plans).
   - **Website access**: only for Business and Enterprise plans, choose between:
     - **Public - Anyone with link can view**
     - **Private - Anyone in workspace can view**
   - **Website info**: customize your app's metadata - icon, title, description, and share image.
3. Click **Review Security** to surface potential security vulnerabilities before going live.

<Danger>
  Always perform a security review before publishing. This helps identify vulnerabilities that could expose sensitive data or allow unauthorized access. Learn more in [Security](/features/security).
</Danger>

4. When ready, click **Publish**.\
   Once deployment is complete, you'll receive a pop-up with the published link. 

You can continue to iterate on your app — when ready to push updates, click **Update** in the **Publish** modal.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I publish my site?">
    If you get an error when publishing your site, it is most likely due to an unsurfaced build error causing the current version of your website not to function. Try troubleshooting the issue by asking the Lovable Agent to investigate it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why can't I see my changes on the published version of my site?">
    Changes aren’t automatically pushed to your live app. To publish updates, click **Publish** and then **Update**.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change my published link (website URL)?">
    Yes. You can change your project URL slug, which forms your [lovable.app](http://lovable.app) website address in two ways:

    1. Click **Publish**, edit your website address, and click **Update**.
    2. Go to **Project settings → Edit URL Slug**, change the URL slug, and click**Update URL Slug** . 

    Note that renaming the project  does not change the project URL, it only changes the project display name.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I unpublish my project?">
    Yes. You can unpublish your project in two ways:

    1. Go to **Project settings **and click****Unpublish project.**** 
    2. Click **Publish**, expand the **Advanced** section, and click **Unpublish**.

    Once unpublished, your app will no longer be accessible to anyone.
