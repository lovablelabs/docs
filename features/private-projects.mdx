Project visibility settings let you control access to your work, whether you want to keep it private, collaborate with your team, or share it publicly. The available options vary depending on your plan.

## Manage project visibility

Project visibility can be managed at both the **workspace level** and **project level**.

- Workspace **admins and owners** can set the **default visibility** for all new projects by going to **Settings → Privacy & Security → Default project visibility**.
- You can override the workspace default for individual projects anytime by going to **Project settings → Project visibility**, and selecting the desired option.

### Project visibility options

You can set project visibility to:

- **Public** (not available for Enterprise)\
  Projects can be **viewed and remixed by anyone**.
- **Workspace**\
  Projects are **private to your workspace** and only **workspace members** can view and collaborate. Ideal for **team collaboration** while keeping work secure.
- **Personal** (available for Business and above)\
  Projects are **visible only to you**. Use for early exploration, prototyping, or individual experimentation. Change to **Workspace** when ready to share and collaborate with your team.

<Note>
  **Important note:**

  - **Before November 6, 2025:** Projects were **public by default** for free plans, and only paid workspaces could change visibility.
  - **After November 6, 2025:** Projects default to **workspace visibility** for all plans, and all workspaces can update visibility of existing projects.
