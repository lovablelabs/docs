Project visibility settings let you control access to your work, whether you want to keep it private, collaborate with your team, or share it publicly.

## Manage project visibility

Project visibility can be managed at both the **workspace level** and **project level**.

- Workspace **admins and owners** can set the **default visibility** for all new projects in a workspace by going to **Settings → Privacy & Security → Default project visibility**.
- You can override the workspace default for individual projects anytime by going to **Project settings → Project visibility**, and selecting the desired option.

### Project visibility options

You can set project visibility to:

- **Public**\
  Projects can be **viewed and remixed by anyone**. Only projects that are not connected to Supabase can be remixed, due to security reasons.
- **Workspace**\
  Projects are **private to your workspace** and only **workspace members** can view and collaborate. Ideal for **team collaboration** while keeping work secure.
- **Personal** (available on Business and above)\
  Projects are **visible only to you**. Use for early exploration, prototyping, or individual experimentation. Change to **Workspace** when ready to share and collaborate with your team.

<Note>
  **Important note:**

  - **Before November 6, 2025:** Projects were **public by default**, and only paid workspaces could change visibility.
  - **After November 6, 2025:** Projects default to **Workspace visibility**, and all workspaces can update existing projects’ visibility.
