Lovable platform has no built-in SEO controls or automation **— SEO is emergent from the code Lovable writes when you ask for it.**

The Agent generally follows modern best practices, but you must **treat SEO as code**: review it, test it, and adjust it.

This guide explains:

- How SEO & GEO work with Lovable’s architecture
- What the Lovable Agent can do for SEO
- What you must manage and maintain
- How to rank well and use workarounds for any limitations

## Understanding Lovable’s architecture

Lovable builds modern web applications using React and Vite, which means your app is a client-side rendered (CSR) single-page application (SPA). Each “page” is a route handled in the browser, not a separate HTML file on the server.

When someone visits your Lovable site:

- The browser receives a minimal HTML shell
- JavaScript downloads and executes
- React renders the full page content in the browser
- Navigation between pages happens via React Router without full reloads

### What this means for SEO and GEO

**Google & traditional search engines**

- Index CSR sites via a two-step process (crawl HTML → render JavaScript later)
- Indexing may be slightly slower than SSR (often days vs hours), but still reliable if configured well

**Social & AI crawlers**

- Many do **not** execute JavaScript, so they mostly see the initial HTML
- If every route shares the same static `<title>` and OG tags, sub-pages may show generic or wrong previews
- AI crawlers (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude, etc.) often can’t see JS-rendered content, so CSR pages may appear minimally or not at all in AI-generated answers unless you add workarounds

Modern search engines handle CSR well. With proper optimization, Lovable sites can rank competitively. CSR does not prevent indexing or ranking—implementation and content quality matter most.

## Make your pages discoverable

_Crawlability, indexing, performance, mobile, internal links_

These actions help search engines find, render, and index your content.

| :-------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Routing & clean URLs**          | Generates clean, human-readable routes (`/about`, `/pricing`) that help search engines understand page intent and improve crawlability.               | - Keep important pages on **stable, descriptive URLs** (no random IDs or query strings for core content).<br />- Avoid multiple URL variants (with/without trailing slash, `www` vs non-`www`).<br />- Test each key route loads without JS errors.                            |
| **Canonical tags**                | Often adds a canonical tag to signal the authoritative URL, preventing duplicate content issues.                                                      | - Confirm **exactly one** canonical tag exists per page.<br />- Ensure the canonical URL matches your preferred version (https, domain, trailing slash convention).<br />- Avoid pointing different pages to the same canonical unless it’s intentional (e.g. filtered views). |
| **robots.txt**                    | Can generate `robots.txt` to allow crawling and reference your sitemap, improving crawl discovery.                                                    | - Host `robots.txt` at `/robots.txt` and confirm it’s publicly accessible.<br />- Ensure you **do not block** essential assets like CSS and JS.<br />- Confirm it links to your sitemap (e.g. `Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`).                                  |
| **XML sitemap**                   | Can create `sitemap.xml` when requested. Sitemaps are essential for CSR apps because some routes are JS-only.                                         | - Regenerate the sitemap whenever you add, remove, or rename important pages.<br />- Ensure all key public routes appear in `sitemap.xml` (home, pricing, docs, blog, etc.).<br />- Submit/refresh the sitemap in Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.              |
| **Performance & Core Web Vitals** | Uses modern optimization patterns (lazy loading, minified bundles) to support fast rendering. Good performance improves rankings and user experience. | - Run Lighthouse (Lovable Speed tool) on critical pages.<br />- Fix pages with poor LCP, CLS, or interaction metrics.<br />- Compress large images and remove unused JS/CSS flagged by Lighthouse.                                                                             |
| **Mobile optimization**           | Produces responsive layouts and includes the viewport meta tag. Supports Google’s mobile-first indexing.                                              | - Test key pages on several phone sizes (DevTools + real devices).<br />- Fix horizontal scroll, overlapping text, or tiny tap targets.<br />- Confirm all primary flows (signup, contact, purchase) work smoothly on mobile.                                                  |
| **Internal linking**              | Creates nav bars and footers that expose key routes and help crawlers navigate your site hierarchy. Can suggest internal links when requested.        | - Add contextual links in body content using descriptive anchor text.<br />- Ensure important pages (e.g. pricing, signup) have **multiple** internal links.<br />- Use real `<a href="…">` links, not `onClick` handlers only.                                                |

## Make your pages meaningful

_Titles, descriptions, headings, semantic HTML, images_

These actions help search engines understand what each page is about.

| SEO feature                   | Agent capabilities                                                                                                       | What you must manage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Title tags**                | Creates a `<title>` that reflects page intent, usually less than 60 characters. A strong title improves ranking and CTR. | - Check each route has a **unique, descriptive** title.<br />- Include a primary keyword plus brand where relevant.<br />- Avoid generic titles like “Home” or repeating the same title everywhere.                                                                |
| **Meta descriptions**         | Adds a summary to influence how your snippet appears in search. Improves CTR even though not a ranking factor.           | - Write a clear 140–160 character description per main page.<br />- Highlight benefits, differentiation, and a soft call to action.<br />- Avoid duplicating the same description across multiple pages.                                                           |
| **Heading structure (H1–H3)** | Creates a single H1 and logical sequence (H1 → H2 → H3). Proper structure helps engines understand page hierarchy.       | - Ensure **exactly one** `<h1>` per page that matches the main topic.<br />- Use `<h2>`/`<h3>` to structure sections logically (no random styling headings).<br />- Avoid using headings purely for styling where a `<p>` or `<span>` would suffice.               |
| **Semantic HTML layout**      | Uses `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, etc. to clarify meaning and improve crawlability and accessibility.    | - Confirm there is a single `<main>` that wraps primary content.<br />- Ensure navigation is inside `<nav>` and repeated footers use `<footer>`.<br />- Group related content into `<section>` and `<article>` elements meaningfully.                              |
| **Image alt text**            | Adds `alt` attributes to images to support accessibility and image search.                                               | - Replace placeholder alt text (“image”, “photo”) with meaningful descriptions.<br />- Add keyword-relevant alt text for important illustrative images (without keyword stuffing).<br />- Ensure decorative images use empty alt (`alt=""`) or are handled by CSS. |
| **Image formats & sizes**     | Uses modern image patterns to improve loading speed. Performance supports rankings.                                      | - Prefer WebP (or AVIF) for photos and SVG for logos/icons.<br />- Keep key images under ~200 KB where possible.<br />- Run Lighthouse and fix “properly sized images” and “serve next-gen formats” warnings.                                                      |

## Make your pages appealing

_Rich results, link previews, social sharing_

These actions improve how your pages appear in Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and social platforms.

| SEO feature                   | Agent capabilities                                                                                                                                                                            | What you must manage                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :---------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Structured data (schema)**  | Can add JSON-LD for `Product`, `Article`, `FAQPage`, `Organization`, etc. Schema helps search engines and AI systems extract structured facts and unlock rich results (stars, FAQ dropdowns). | - Add JSON-LD schema to key pages (home, products, blog posts, FAQ).<br />- Validate snippets using Google’s Rich Results Test.<br />- Fix missing required fields and keep structured data in sync with on-page content.                     |
| **Open Graph & Twitter tags** | Can generate OG/Twitter tags for improved link previews and better content interpretation by social and AI crawlers.                                                                          | - Ensure each important route has unique OG title and description in the HTML.<br />- Verify OG/Twitter tags render correct previews using official debug tools.<br />- Avoid using generic, site-wide tags for all pages unless intentional. |
| **OG images**                 | Can add default or custom OG images. High-quality images dramatically improve share performance and brand trust.                                                                              | - Create 1200×630px (approx.) preview images for main pages.<br />- Keep image files under ~1 MB and visually consistent with your brand.<br />- Avoid using a single OG image for every page unless you have no better option.               |

## Make your content LLM-friendly (GEO)

_Visibility in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude_

Most GEO best practices are extensions of good SEO. If you follow the earlier sections plus the extras here, you’ll be in good shape.

Generative engines extract information differently than search engines. Most do not execute JavaScript, so they rely heavily on static HTML and schema.

| GEO feature                       | Agent capabilities                                                                                                                               | What you must manage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| :-------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Semantic HTML & schema for AI** | Provides clean structure and can add schema when requested. LLM crawlers read HTML directly because they rarely execute JS.                      | - Put your key facts (what you do, who you serve, pricing basics) in static HTML, not only in JS-generated widgets.<br />- Add `Organization`, `Product`, `FAQPage`, and other relevant schema.<br />- Keep facts consistent across your site, schema, and external profiles. |
| **LLM-friendly summary page**     | Can build a dedicated static page (`/llm`, `/about-ai`) summarizing your company, products, FAQs, and key information in one crawlable location. | - Request a dedicated `/llm` or similar page and keep it up to date.<br />- Structure the page with clear headings and concise, factual sections.<br />- Include schema (`Organization`, `FAQPage`, etc.) so LLMs can extract structured facts.                               |
| **Prerendering**                  | Works with external prerendering tools to serve bots full HTML snapshots of your SPA, bypassing JS limitations.                                  | - Choose and configure a prerendering service (e.g. via your host/proxy).<br />- Prerender key SEO and GEO routes: `/`, `/pricing`, `/about`, `/llm`, landing pages.<br />- Test with “View source” and URL inspection tools to confirm bots see full HTML content.           |
| **LLM-quotable content patterns** | Can generate FAQs, definitions, short answers, and structured content that LLMs reuse verbatim.                                                  | - Write clear, concise answers to common questions in FAQ/Q&A formats.<br />- Use definition blocks (“X is…”) that are easy to quote.<br />- Avoid overly fluffy or vague copy that’s hard to reuse.                                                                          |
| **AI bot access (robots.txt)**    | Can configure access rules for GPTBot, PerplexityBot, etc.                                                                                       | - Decide which AI crawlers you want to allow or block.<br />- Explicitly allow or disallow AI bots in `robots.txt` based on your strategy.<br />- Re-check `robots.txt` after changes to ensure you haven’t accidentally blocked desired bots.                                |

## SEO and GEO checklist

Run through this checklist for any Lovable project to ensure you follow best SEO and GEO practices.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="1. Confirm crawlability foundations">
    **robots.txt**

    - Ask Lovable:

      > “Create a robots.txt that allows all bots and references my sitemap.”
    - Make sure the file is located at:
      - `/public/robots.txt` in your project
      - Accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt`
    - Verify that it:
      - Does **not** block `/assets/`, CSS, or JS.
      - Includes a `Sitemap:` line pointing to your sitemap URL.

    **XML sitemap**

    - Ask Lovable:

      > “Generate or update sitemap.xml with all public routes.”
    - Publish your project so the file is live.
    - Verify it is accessible at:
      - `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
    - In Google Search Console → **Sitemaps**:
      - Submit the sitemap URL.
      - Re-submit after adding/removing key pages.

    **AI bot access (optional but recommended for GEO)**

    - Decide your AI visibility strategy (allow vs disallow GPTBot, PerplexityBot, etc.).
    - Edit `robots.txt`, for example:

      ```
      User-agent: GPTBot
      Allow: /
      
      User-agent: PerplexityBot
      Allow: /
      
      ```
    - Re-check that `robots.txt` still allows normal search engine bots (Googlebot, Bingbot).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="2. Verify on-page SEO basics">
    Do this per important route (for example, home, pricing, feature pages, docs, blog posts, /llm, and so on).

    **Titles & descriptions**

    In your browser DevTools console on each page:

    ```
    // Check page title
    console.log('Title:', document.title);
    
    // Check meta description
    console.log(
      'Description:',
      document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]')?.content
    );
    ```

    - Ensure the title is unique, descriptive, and not too long.
    - Ensure the description exists and is tailored to the page.

    If titles or descriptions repeat across pages, ask Lovable:

    > “Install react-helmet-async and set unique titles and descriptions for each route.”

    **H1 and heading structure**

    In the console:

    ```
    // Ensure exactly one H1 tag, should return 1
    console.log('H1 count:', document.querySelectorAll('h1').length);
    ```

    - Confirm:
      - Exactly one `<h1>` per page.
      - Headings flow logically (`<h2>` for major sections, `<h3>` for subsections).
    - If there are multiple H1s, ask Lovable:

      > “Ensure this page uses exactly one H1 and convert the others to H2/H3.”

    **Canonical URL**

    In the console:

    ```
    // Validate canonical URL
    console.log(
      'Canonical:',
      document.querySelector('link[rel="canonical"]')?.href
    );
    ```

    - Ensure each page has a canonical URL.
    - Make sure it matches your preferred domain and URL variant (HTTPS, trailing slash).

    **Images and alt text**

    In the console:

    ```
    // Confirm all images have alt text
    console.log(
      'Images without alt:',
      document.querySelectorAll('img:not([alt])').length
    );
    ```

    - Ensure important images have descriptive `alt` attributes.
    - Decorative images can use `alt=""` or be implemented via CSS.
    - Check file sizes in Network tab and compress large files (\> 200 KB) where possible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="3. Validate structured data and GEO/AI signals">
    **JSON-LD schema**

    In the console:

    ```
    // Check for structured data (JSON-LD)
    console.log(
      'Schema blocks:',
      document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]').length
    );
    ```

    - Ensure important routes include appropriate schema, for example:
      - `Organization` on home/about.
      - `Product` on pricing/product pages.
      - `FAQPage` wherever you have FAQs.
    - Use:
      - [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results) to validate.
      - Fix any missing required fields or errors.

    For example, if schema is missing, ask Lovable:

    > “Add JSON-LD schema for this product/blog post/FAQ section.”

    **LLM summary page**

    - For example, ask Lovable:

      > “Create a /llm page summarizing our company, offerings, differentiators, contact info, and 8–12 FAQs using semantic HTML and Organization + FAQPage schema.”
    - Confirm the page:
      - Uses clear headings and concise sections.
      - Includes accurate and up-to-date information.
      - Has appropriate schema blocks.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="4. Check social and sharing previews">
    **Open Graph and Twitter Cards**

    For key pages, use:

    - [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
    - [X (Twitter) Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
    - [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)

    Check that:

    - The preview title and description match the page’s intent.
    - The link preview uses the correct OG image (not your logo or a random asset unless you intend that).

    For example, if previews are wrong or generic, ask Lovable:

    > “Add unique OG tags for /pricing with this title, description, and image…”

    **OG images**

    Confirm images are:

    - ~1200×630px (or platform-friendly ratio).
    - Under ~1 MB file size.
    - Branded and visually consistent.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="5. Test performance and mobile experience">
    **Core Web Vitals & Lighthouse**

    Lovable includes **page speed auditing powered by**[** Google Lighthouse**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) — the same engine Google uses for performance evaluation.

    - In Lovable, run the **Speed** tool  on core pages.
    - Aim for:
      - Performance: 90+
      - Accessibility: 90+
      - Best Practices: 90+
      - SEO: 100

    Focus on Lighthouse recommendations, especially:

    - Large LCP images or hero sections.
    - Render-blocking scripts or styles.
    - Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) issues (missing image dimensions, layout jumps).
    - Unused JS/CSS.

    Fix issues by:

    - Compressing and properly sizing images.
    - Removing or lazy-loading non-critical scripts.
    - Setting explicit width/height on images.

    **Mobile usability**

    - Use DevTools device mode and real devices where possible.
    - Confirm:
      - No sideways scrolling on small screens.
      - Buttons and links are easily tappable.
      - Forms and modals work correctly on touch devices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="6. Configure prerendering (when needed)">
    Prerendering is a strong upgrade if you have:

    - Content-heavy sites,
    - SEO-driven businesses,
    - Or care strongly about AI visibility

    1. Choose a prerendering service:

    - [Prerender.io](http://Prerender.io): Industry standard, most tested 
    - [DataJelly](https://datajelly.app/): Alternative with similar features
    - [Rendertron](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron): Open-source (free, requires hosting)

    2. Configure your hosting/proxy to:

    - Detect bots.
    - Serve prerendered HTML snapshots to them.

    3. Prerender at least:

    - `/`
    - `/pricing`
    - `/about`
    - `/llm`
    - Key landing and blog pages.

    4. Verify `View source` as Googlebot (e.g. via tools or GSC’s URL Inspection) shows full HTML with content and schema.

  <Accordion title="7. Set up ongoing monitoring and maintenance">
    This is how you ensure continuous SEO and GEO health.

    #### Google Search Console (GSC)

    GSC is your window into what Google sees:

    - Which pages are indexed
    - Impressions, clicks, CTR, and average position
    - Core Web Vitals from real users
    - Crawl coverage and errors
    - Mobile usability issues

    Lovable has no built-in GSC integration, so setup is manual but straightforward.

    1. **Verify site ownership**

    Choose one method:

    - **DNS TXT record (recommended)** — add it via your domain provider.
    - **Meta tag** — ask Lovable:

      > “Add this Google Search Console verification meta tag to the `<head>` of my site…”
    - **HTML file** — download Google’s verification file and ask Lovable to place it at the site root (usually `/public`).

    2. **Submit your sitemap**

    - In GSC → **Sitemaps**, add`https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml`
    - It can take some time for Google to process and show coverage.

    3. **Use URL Inspection**

    For any important URL:

    - Paste it into **URL Inspection**.
    - Click **Test Live URL**.
    - Review:
      - Screenshot of what Googlebot sees.
      - Rendered HTML.
      - Console errors.
      - Blocked resources.

    If it looks correct, you can click **Request indexing** for key pages (rate-limited but useful for launches/updates).

    4. **Monitor reports weekly**

    - **Coverage / Page indexing**
      - Indexed vs excluded pages.
      - Reasons for exclusion (redirects, canonicalization, noindex, etc.).
    - **Performance (Search results)**
      - Queries, impressions, clicks, CTR, average position.
      - Which pages gain or lose visibility.
    - **Core Web Vitals**
      - Real-world LCP, interaction latency, CLS.
      - Compare mobile vs desktop.
    - **Mobile usability**
      - Issues with viewport, tap targets, content width.

    #### Suggested maintenance schedule

    **Weekly**

    - Check GSC Coverage for new errors and newly indexed pages.
    - Glance at search performance trends.
    - Run URL Inspection for newly important URLs and request indexing if needed.

    **Monthly**

    - Update `sitemap.xml` if pages changed.
    - Refresh underperforming titles/descriptions (low CTR pages).
    - Run a Lighthouse audit on your main templates.
    - Do a small round of content improvements or link building.

    **Quarterly**

    - Do a deeper technical audit: c

      anonicals, `robots.txt`, schema, internal links, mobile usability.
    - Review keyword performance and top landing pages.
    - Refresh older content that is slipping in rankings or out of date.

## SEO and GEO FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can my site rank well on search using Lovable?">
    Yes. Lovable apps can rank like any modern JavaScript site. As long as resources aren’t blocked and pages load normally, Google can index and rank them. Examples performing well today:

    - [sparklestales.com](http://sparklestales.com)
    - [workveg.com](http://workveg.com)
    - [renamify.co](http://renamify.co)

    Follow the technical and content recommendations in this guide—especially metadata, performance, and sitemap configuration—for the best results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When is Lovable a good fit for SEO, and when should I consider SSR or prerendering?">
    ### **Lovable is a strong fit when SEO is helpful but not the sole growth engine**, or when the site is small enough for manual SEO:

    - Marketing sites & landing pages
    - Startups needing a fast, professional web presence
    - Simple blogs or docs sites (≈ ≤ 200 pages)
    - Portfolios and personal sites
    - Internal tools/dashboards (SEO irrelevant)
    - Apps behind authentication (should not be indexed)
    - Small sites (≈ 5–20 pages) with manageable metadata
    - Projects driven by referrals, social, paid, or product usage

    **Why:**\
    You can easily review meta tags, sitemaps, internal links, and performance manually.

    ### **Lovable is still workable but more challenging** when ranking is important and pages are numerous or competitive:

    - Content-heavy blogs (50+ articles)
    - Medium e-commerce sites (hundreds of products)
    - Local directories
    - News/media or time-sensitive hubs
    - Sites dependent on organic search
    - Competitive markets (health, finance, legal, SaaS)
    - Projects needing reliable AI/LLM visibility

    **Why:**

    - More pages → more manual metadata & sitemap upkeep
    - CSR can slow Google’s rendering pass
    - Social & AI crawlers don’t execute JS
    - Competing against SSR sites is harder

    ### **Lovable is a poor fit without prerendering or SSR** for very large or SEO-critical projects:

    - Large content catalogs (≈ 500+ pages)
    - Massive e-commerce (thousands of products)
    - Big news or magazine sites
    - Businesses where ~70%+ traffic must come from SEO
    - Highly competitive or time-sensitive markets
    - Multilingual/multilocale sites
    - Projects where AI visibility is mission-critical

    **Why:**\
    SSR/hybrid frameworks give real structural advantages for large-scale or SEO-dependent websites.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When do I need a custom domain?">
    Use a **custom domain** if you care about:

    - Organic search traffic
    - Long-term brand building
    - Competitive SEO
    - Backlink value
    - Full control over technical SEO

    A lovable.app subdomain is fine for:

    - MVPs
    - Demos
    - Temporary landing pages
    - Internal tools
    - Social/paid-driven projects

    But for meaningful SEO, a custom domain is the #1 upgrade.

    Without one:

    - You don’t build domain authority.
    - Long-term rankings suffer.
    - Brand trust is lower.
    - Technical SEO control is limited.

    Set it up via Domains → Connect a custom domain in your Lovable project. This is arguably the #1 SEO upgrade you can make.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the main CSR SEO limitations, and how do I work around them?">
    - Indexing can be slower than SSR\
      → Submit a sitemap, use URL Inspection, or add prerendering.
    - AI crawlers and some bots don’t run JS\
      → Use semantic HTML + schema; add prerendering if AI visibility is important; consider an LLM summary page.
    - Social previews don’t run JS\
      → Add Open Graph and Twitter Card tags in static HTML (and prerender if needed).
    - Metadata doesn’t update automatically across routes\
      → Ask Lovable to install react-helmet-async and configure per-route titles/descriptions.
    - Bing’s JS rendering is weaker than Google’s\
      → Prerendering can improve results if Bing matters to you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is prerendering, and do I need it?">
    Prerendering/dynamic rendering gives bots a static HTML snapshot while users get the JS app. It’s particularly helpful for:

    - Content-heavy sites
    - Frequent new content
    - SEO-heavy/competitive niches
    - Need for fast indexing
    - Strong AI/LLM visibility

    Lovable doesn’t bundle prerendering; you integrate an external service ([Prerender.io](http://Prerender.io), DataJelly, Rendertron, etc.) via your hosting/proxy.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can AI search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) index Lovable apps?">
    Today, AI crawlers from these systems cannot fully execute JavaScript-rendered content, so they only reliably see the initial HTML.\
    However:

    - Clean semantic HTML
    - Meaningful headings and structured content
    - Schema markup

    …all help AI crawlers extract facts for their knowledge graphs even without JS execution.\
    If AI visibility is important, prerendering or SSR becomes more valuable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need an XML sitemap for my Lovable site?">
    Yes. Sitemaps are especially important for CSR apps because crawlers might not see all JS-generated routes.

    - Ask Lovable to create/update `sitemap.xml`.
    - Publish the site so it’s accessible.
    - Submit it to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools.

    This ensures that all important pages are seen and indexed.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I get the best SEO results with Lovable?">
    To get the strongest results:

    ### **1. Content & on-page**

    - Target long-tail keywords
    - Write comprehensive pages (pillar pages often 1,500+ words)
    - Match search intent clearly
    - Keep content fresh and updated
    - Use clean headings and semantic HTML
    - Add JSON-LD schema on key pages

    ### **2. Images**

    - Compress large files
    - Use meaningful alt text
    - Prefer WebP/AVIF or SVG

    ### **3. Internal links**

    - Use descriptive anchor text
    - Link between related pages
    - Ensure important URLs have multiple internal links

    ### **4. Technical**

    - Optimize performance (Core Web Vitals)
    - Ensure mobile usability
    - Verify metadata on every page
    - Keep a correct sitemap and robots.txt

    ### **5. Backlinks**

    High-quality backlinks help compensate for CSR limitations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What user best practices help SEO on Lovable?">

    - No horizontal scroll
    - Proper tap targets
    - Stable layout
    - Working navigation/forms

    Good mobile UX supports both SEO and conversions.
  </Accordion>
