Lovable lets you build websites together. Invite your designer, developer, agency, or anyone else. Everyone sees changes as they happen.

There are two ways of collaborating. You can invite collaborators to a specific project or to your entire workspace.

## Collaboration in a specific project

You can invite users to work together on a specific project by pressing "Invite" in the project editor.
Add their email, and they'll receive an invite to their email.

<Note>
  Collaborators will use credits from the project owner's workspace.

### Project permissions

## Collaboration in a Workspace

### What is a Workspace?

A workspace is your shared space for building and collaborating on projects. You can invite your teammates to your workspace, and they'll have access to all the projects in it.
They can see, edit and publish the workspaces's projects.

<Warning>
  For granular permission control and role assignment in your workspace, a paid subscription is needed.
</Warning>

When you subscribe to a plan it gets tied to your desired workspace, and then all projects in the workspace use those credits, no matter who sends the messages.

You can customize your workspace in the workspace settings by:

- Renaming it
- Changing the avatar
- Writing a description

### How do I add and manage collaborators in a Workspace?

You manage and add collaborators from the People tab in the workspace settings. You can access it by going to **Settings** \> **People**.

Here you can:

- Add new collaborators by inputting their email. They'll receive an invite to their email that they then can accept.
- Manage existing collaborators by changing their roles or removing them.
- See monthly credits usage for each collaborator

### Workspace permissions

Please note that free plans do not have admin roles.
