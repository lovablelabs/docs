description: "Make your published Lovable websites discoverable by Google, social platforms, and AI systems."

Lovable platform has no built-in SEO controls or automation — **SEO is emergent from the code Lovable writes when you ask for it.**

The Lovable Agent:

- May generate certain elements as part of content creation—for example, titles, descriptions, or tags inferred from your prompts, but not systematically.
- Can assist in generating site structure and content and generally follows modern best practices, but it doesn’t guarantee correct SEO implementation.

You must **treat SEO as code**: review it, test it, and adjust it.

## Understanding Lovable’s architecture

Lovable builds modern web applications using React and Vite, which means your app is a client-side rendered (CSR) single-page application (SPA). Each “page” is a route handled in the browser, not a separate HTML file on the server.

**Traditional sites**, like WordPress or Webflow, send you a complete, ready-to-read page. Each page is a separate file sitting on a server.

**Lovable sites** send your browser instructions that assemble the page on your device. All your "pages" are actually different views of a single application, which is why it's called a single-page application (SPA).

For visitors, there's no difference—pages load instantly and navigation feels seamless. But for search engines, there are important implications.

### What this means for SEO and GEO

**Google and traditional search engines:**

- Can index Lovable sites, but use a two-step process (crawl HTML → render JavaScript later): first they collect your page structure, then they come back later to see the rendered content
- Indexing takes slightly longer—typically days instead of hours—but is still reliable when configured properly
- This delay doesn't hurt your rankings; it just means new pages take longer to appear in search results

**Social media and AI systems:**

- Facebook, X (Twitter), and LinkedIn don't wait for content to render—they see only your initial page structure
- If all your pages share the same basic title and preview image, social links may show generic or incorrect information
- AI systems (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Claude) often can't see dynamically rendered content, so they may miss your pages entirely

**Modern search engines handle CSR well**. CSR does not prevent indexing or ranking—implementation and content quality matter most.

Follow these practices to ensure your Lovable site is fully optimized for search engines and AI systems and can rank competitively.

## Foundation: Make your site crawlable

These actions help search engines find and index your content.

### XML sitemap

Sitemaps help search engines discover all your pages—critical for CSR sites where crawlers can't easily find all routes. Lovable can generate sitemap.xml with all public routes when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify sitemap.xml">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Create XML sitemap at /sitemap.xml listing all public routes. Include lastmod dates and priorities: homepage 1.0, main pages 0.8, blog posts 0.6. Exclude admin and account pages.

  **Verify**

  - Publish your project so the file is live
  - Check that it is accessible at: `https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml` (should return XML)
  - Check all key routes included (home, main pages, blog, products)
  - Submit to Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools
  - Regenerate and resubmit when adding/removing pages (not automatic). Prompt:

    > Update sitemap.xml to include /new-page and remove /old-page then resubmit to Google Search Console.
</Accordion>

### Robots.txt

Controls which parts of your site search engines can access. Essential to prevent blocking critical resources that Google needs to render your content. Lovable can generate robots.txt when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify robots.txt">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Create robots.txt at /public/robots.txt that allows all crawlers, references Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml, and allows GPTBot and PerplexityBot for AI visibility.

  **Verify**

  - Check that it is accessible at: `https://yourdomain.com/robots.txt`
  - Confirm it does NOT block CSS, JavaScript, or `/assets/` folder
  - Includes `Sitemap:` line pointing to your sitemap
  - Controls AI bot access (GPTBot, PerplexityBot) based on your strategy

  **Example**

  ```
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  Sitemap: https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
  
  User-agent: GPTBot
  Allow: /
  ```
</Accordion>

### Canonical tags

Tells search engines which URL is the "official" version when you have similar content, preventing duplicate content issues. Lovable can generate canonical tags when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify canonical tags">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Add canonical tags to all pages pointing to their own URLs. Use https://yourdomain.com format with no trailing slash.

  **Verify**

  - Check each page. Paste this in browser console:

    ```
    console.log('Canonical:', document.querySelector('link[rel="canonical"]')?.href);
    ```
  - Confirm **exactly one** canonical tag exists per page.
  - Make sure it matches your preferred domain and URL variant (HTTPS, trailing slash).
  - Avoid pointing different pages to the same canonical unless it’s intentional (for example, filtered product views).
</Accordion>

### Clean URLs and routing

Search engines use URLs to understand page topics. Clean, descriptive URLs improve crawlability and rankings. Lovable usually generates clean routes via React Router automatically.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify clean URLs and routing">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Review all routes. Ensure product pages use clean URLs like /products/organic-dog-food instead of /products?id=123. Use hyphens to separate words.

  **Verify**

  - Navigate to each route and check browser console for errors
  - URLs should be: stable, descriptive, no random IDs
  - Consistent format site-wide (trailing slash or not, www or not)
  - All routes load without JavaScript errors
</Accordion>

### Internal linking

Helps search engines discover pages and understand site structure. Distributes page authority and improves navigation. Lovable can create nav/footer links and can suggest contextual links when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify internal linking">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Add 3-5 contextual internal links in /blog/dog-nutrition to related posts and products. Use descriptive anchor text like 'grain-free dog food options' instead of 'click here'.

  **Verify**

  - Check links are crawlable:

    ```
    console.log('Links:', document.querySelectorAll('a[href]').length);
    ```
  - Use real `<a href>` tags, not onClick handlers
  - Important pages have multiple internal links pointing to them
  - Anchor text is descriptive with keywords (not "click here")
    - **Good anchor text:** "organic dog food benefits"
    - **Bad anchor text:** "click here", "read more"
  - Deep pages reachable within 3 clicks from homepage
</Accordion>

## On-page SEO: Help search engines understand content

These actions make your pages meaningful and help search engines understand what each page is about.

### Page titles

Most important on-page ranking factor. Appears in search results and browser tabs, directly impacts click-through rates. Lovable can create title tags reflecting page intent.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify page titles">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Update page titles for all routes. Format: 'Page Name | PetFood Co'. Keep under 60 characters. Examples: 'Organic Dog Food Delivery | PetFood Co' for homepage, 'Flexible Pricing Plans | PetFood Co' for /pricing.

  **Verify**

  - Check title content and length for each page. Paste this in the browser console:

    ```
    console.log('Title:', document.title, '| Length:', document.title.length);
    ```
  - Each route has unique, descriptive title (not generic "Home" everywhere)
  - Under 60 characters to avoid truncation
  - Includes primary keyword plus brand name
</Accordion>

### Meta descriptions

Appear in search results below title. Not a ranking factor but significantly impact click-through rates. Lovable adds meta descriptions when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify meta descriptions">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Write unique meta descriptions for key pages (140-160 chars): Homepage: 'Premium organic dog food delivered fresh. Free shipping over \$50. Shop grain-free options.' Pricing: 'Flexible plans starting at \$45/month. Cancel anytime.' About: 'Family-owned organic dog food company. 10+ years serving 50,000+ dogs.'

  **Verify**

  - Check description and length for each page. Paste this in the browser console:

    ```
    console.log('Desc:', document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]')?.content, '| Length:', document.querySelector('meta[name="description"]')?.content.length);
    ```
  - Each page has unique description (140-160 characters)
    - **Bad**: "Welcome to our website" (generic, repeated)
    - **Good**: "Premium organic dog food delivered fresh to your door. Free shipping over \$50." (158 chars)
  - Highlights benefits, differentiation, and a soft call to action
  - Not duplicated across pages
</Accordion>

### Heading structure (H1 → H3)

Helps search engines understand content organization and section importance. Lovable can create H1 tags and logical heading hierarchy.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify heading structure">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Review heading structure on /about. Ensure exactly one H1: 'About PetFood Co - Organic Dog Nutrition Experts'. Use H2 for main sections (Our Story, Mission, Team) and H3 for subsections. Don't skip heading levels.

  **Verify**

  - Check there is only one H1 tag:

    ```
    console.log('H1s:', document.querySelectorAll('h1').length);
    ```
  - View content:

    ```
    console.log('H1:', document.querySelector('h1')?.textContent);
    ```
  - H1 includes primary keyword and states page purpose
  - Headings flow logically (H1 → H2 → H3, never skip levels)
  - Not used purely for styling
</Accordion>

### Semantic HTML

Uses tags that describe content meaning, helping search engines and screen readers understand page structure. Lovable uses semantic elements like `<main>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify semantic HTML">
  **Prompt  to add**

  For example:

  > Review HTML structure. Ensure hero and main content in \<main\>, navigation in \<nav\>, feature sections in \<section\>, blog posts in \<article\>, footer in \<footer\>. Replace generic \<div\> wrappers with semantic tags.

  **Verify**

  - For example, paste this in browser console - all should return `true`:

  ```
  console.log('Has <main>:', !!document.querySelector('main'));
  console.log('Has <nav>:', !!document.querySelector('nav'));
  console.log('Has <footer>:', !!document.querySelector('footer'));
  console.log('Has <section>:', !!document.querySelector('section'));
  ```

  - Check the following for each page:
    - Single `<main>` wraps primary content
    - Navigation inside `<nav>`
    - Footer content in `<footer>`
    - Related content in `<section>` and `<article>` tags
</Accordion>

### Image optimization

High-quality alt text improves accessibility, supports image search visibility, and contributes to stronger topical relevance signals. Efficient image formats and sizing improve page speed—another important ranking factor. Lovable can add alt attributes and lazy loading.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify image optimization">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Review all images on /products. Update alt text to be descriptive and keyword-relevant. Example: Instead of 'product image', use 'organic grain-free dog food bag with chicken and vegetables'. Ensure all images have width/height attributes and are compressed to \<200KB.

  **Verify**

  - Confirm every image has alt text. Paste this in browser console - should be 0:

    ```
    console.log('Missing alt:', document.querySelectorAll('img:not([alt])').length);
    ```
  - Evaluate alt text quality - must be descriptive with relevant keywords (not "image" or empty)
    - Bad: `alt="image"` or `alt="photo"`
    - Good: `alt="Golden retriever eating organic grain-free dog food from a bowl"`
  - Use proper file formats and keep file sizes small:
    - WebP for photos and illustrations
    - SVG for logos, icons, and simple graphics
    - Images compressed under 200KB
  - Width/height attributes present (prevents layout shift)
</Accordion>

## Rich results: Stand out in search

These actions improve how your pages appear in Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) and social platforms.

### Structured data (JSON-LD schema)

Helps search engines understand content type and unlocks rich results (star ratings, FAQ dropdowns, product cards). Lovable can add JSON-LD schema when explicitly requested.

**Common schema types**

- **Product** — price, availability, reviews, ratings
- **Article** — author, publish date, featured image
- **FAQPage** — question/answer pairs
- **LocalBusiness** — address, phone number, hours

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify structured data">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Add Product schema to /products/\* pages. Include: name, description, price, currency (USD), availability (InStock), image, brand (PetFood Co), aggregateRating with ratingValue and reviewCount.

  **Verify**

  - Check presence on key pages (for example, home, products, blog posts, FAQ). Paste this in browser console - should be 1:

  ```
  console.log('Schema:', document.querySelectorAll('script[type="application/ld+json"]').length);
  ```

  - Validate with [Google Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
  - Fix any errors or missing required fields
  - Keep schema data synchronized with visible page content
</Accordion>

### Social media optimization: Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and OG images

Control how preview links appear when shared on social media. High-quality images dramatically improve share performance and brand trust.

Lovable includes baseline OG/Twitter tags in the template, but **you must customize image, title, and description per page**.

Most social platforms (Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn) **do not execute JavaScript**, which means your site may show **generic or incomplete link previews** unless you explicitly configure Open Graph (OG) and Twitter Card metadata in the initial HTML

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and OG images">
  You have **two options** for managing social metadata:

  - Prompt Lovable
  - Update manually via GitHub or code editor

  **Prompt to add Open Graph and Twitter Cards**

  For example:

  > Add unique Open Graph tags to /pricing: og:title 'Flexible Pricing Plans | PetFood Co', og:description 'Choose monthly or annual plans. Cancel anytime.', og:image '/og-pricing.jpg', og:url 'https://petfoodco.com/pricing'. Include twitter:card 'summary_large_image'.

  **Prompt to add OG image**

  > Create custom OG images for homepage, pricing, about. Each should be 1200x630px JPG, include page title text overlaid on brand visuals, keep under 800KB. Upload to /public/og-images/ and update og:image tags.

  **Update manually**

  Replace or update your og:image file manually (via GitHub or the code editor) for complete creative control over the preview image.

  **Verify**

  - Before sharing any URL, verify how it appears:
    - [Facebook Sharing Debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/)
    - [X (Twitter) Card Validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator)
    - [LinkedIn Post Inspector](https://www.linkedin.com/post-inspector/)
  - Each important page has unique og:title, og:description, og:image, og:url in the HTML
  - Tags include twitter:card and twitter:image
  - Preview shows correct title, description, image
  - Images are 1200×630px, and under 1MB
  - Visually consistent with brand
  - Avoid using single generic image for every page

  **Example**

  ```
  <meta property="og:title" content="Organic Dog Food Delivery | PetFood Co" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Premium grain-free dog food delivered fresh to your door." />
  <meta property="og:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/og-image.jpg" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://yourdomain.com/products" />
  <meta name="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
  <meta name="twitter:image" content="https://yourdomain.com/og-image.jpg" />
  
  ```
</Accordion>

## Performance and mobile

These actions help search engines render your content.

### Core Web Vitals and performance

Page speed is a confirmed ranking factor. Faster sites rank higher and convert better. Lovable uses modern optimization patterns like lazy loading and code minification to support fast rendering.

**Core Web Vitals targets**

| Metric                             | Target  | What it measures                       | How to fix                                                                                                       |
| ---------------------------------- | :------ | :------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **LCP** (Largest Contentful Paint) | \<2.5s  | Time until main content appears        | Compress hero images, use WebP, preload critical resources, reduce server response time                          |
| **FID** (First Input Delay)        | \<100ms | Time until page responds to user input | Reduce JavaScript execution time, defer non-critical scripts, break up long tasks                                |
| **CLS** (Cumulative Layout Shift)  | \<0.1   | Visual stability while loading         | Add width/height to all images, reserve space for dynamic content, avoid inserting content above fold after load |

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify core web vitals and performance">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > "Fix Lighthouse performance issues on homepage: Compress hero image to \<200KB, add width/height to all images, defer non-critical JavaScript, preload hero image and fonts. Target 90+ Performance score."

  **Verify**

  - Run **Speed** tool in Lovable (Google Lighthouse audit)
  - Target scores:
    - Performance: 90+
    - Accessibility: 90+
    - Best Practices: 90+
    - SEO: 100
  - Core Web Vitals: LCP \<2.5s, FID \<100ms, CLS \<0.1
  - Fix pages with poor performance scores
    - Compress large images
    - Remove unused JavaScript/CSS flagged by Lighthouse
    - Add width/height attributes to images (prevents layout shift)
</Accordion>

### Mobile optimization

More than 60% of searches happen on mobile. Google uses mobile-first indexing—your mobile version determines rankings. Lovable produces responsive layouts with viewport tag.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify mobile optimization">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Review mobile experience. Increase tap target sizes to minimum 48x48px, add spacing between interactive elements, ensure text is minimum 16px, fix any horizontal scroll on small screens.

  **Verify**

  - Test key pages on several device sizes, test iPhone, Android, tablet sizes (Chrome DevTools + real devices).
  - Confirm all primary flows work smoothly on mobile
  - No horizontal scrolling on any page
  - Text readable without zooming (minimum 16px font size)
  - Buttons/links at least 48×48px, with spacing between, and easily tappable
  - Forms work properly on touch devices (large inputs, clear labels)
  - Navigation accessible (hamburger menu functional)
  - Images and videos fit within screen width
</Accordion>

## GEO: Make your content AI/LLM-friendly

Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) helps AI systems like ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, and Claude discover and cite your content. Generative engines extract information differently than search engines. Most do not execute JavaScript, so they rely heavily on static HTML and schema.

Most GEO best practices are extensions of good SEO. If you follow the earlier sections plus the extras here, you’ll be in good shape.

### Semantic HTML and schema for AI

AI crawlers read HTML directly without executing JavaScript. Clear structure and schema help them extract facts for citations. Lovable provides semantic structure and can add schema when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify semantic HTML and schema for AI">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Review homepage for AI crawlers. Ensure company description, services, and differentiators are in clear HTML paragraphs with semantic headings, not hidden in JavaScript state. Add Organization schema with name, description, url, logo, sameAs (social profiles).

  **Verify**

  - Put key facts in static HTML (for example, what you do, who you serve, pricing)
  - Use clear headings (`<h2>`, `<h3>`) to structure information
  - Add comprehensive schema: Organization, Product, FAQPage, Article
  - Write in clear, factual language that AI can parse and cite
  - Keep facts consistent across your site, schema, and external profiles.
</Accordion>

### AI bot access (robots.txt)

Controls which AI systems can access your content for training or answering queries. Configure in robots.txt to allow desired bots.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify AI bot access in robots.txt">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Update robots.txt to allow GPTBot, PerplexityBot, and Claude-Web for AI citations. Block Google-Extended and CCBot to prevent AI training. Keep search engine crawlers allowed.

  **Verify**

  - Decide visibility strategy: allow AI citations or block AI training
  - Explicitly allow or block bots based on strategy
    - Common bots: GPTBot (ChatGPT), PerplexityBot, Claude-Web, Google-Extended (training), CCBot
  - Re-check after changes to ensure desired bots aren't accidentally blocked

  **Example**

  ```
  User-agent: *
  Allow: /
  
  User-agent: GPTBot
  Allow: /
  
  User-agent: Google-Extended
  Disallow: /
  ```
</Accordion>

### LLM-quotable content patterns

AI systems prefer clear, structured content they can confidently quote. Help them cite your information accurately. Lovable can generate FAQ sections and structured content when requested.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify LLM-quotable content patterns">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Review FAQ section. Rewrite answers to be quotable by AI: start with direct answer in first sentence, 2-3 sentences total, include specific facts/numbers, avoid vague marketing language. Example: Instead of 'Our food helps dogs feel their best' write 'Organic dog food reduces digestive issues in 65% of dogs and provides 30% more nutrients than conventional options.'

  **Verify**

  - Write clear answers to common questions in FAQ/Q&A format
  - Use definition patterns that are easy to quote: "X is [clear definition]"
  - Avoid vague marketing copy
  - Create lists and bullet points for easy parsing
  - Include statistics with sources when possible

  **Examples**

  - Bad: "Amazing transformative solutions"
  - Good: "USDA-certified organic dog food delivered weekly. Plans start at \$45/month with free shipping over \$50."
</Accordion>

### Static LLM-friendly summary page

A dedicated page summarizing your company makes it easy for AI systems to understand and cite your information. Lovable can build dedicated summary pages (like `/llm`, `/about-ai`) with key information in crawlable format.

<Accordion title="How to implement and verify LLM-friendly summary page">
  **Prompt to add**

  For example:

  > Create /llm page with: company description (2 paragraphs), products/services list, key differentiators, pricing summary, 10 FAQs with factual answers, contact info. Add Organization and FAQPage schema. Use clear H2/H3 headings and factual language.

  **Verify**

  - Create page at `/llm` or `/about-ai`
  - Structure with clear H2/H3 headings
  - Include, for example: company summary, products/services, differentiators, pricing model, contact info, FAQs
  - Add Organization and FAQPage schema so LLMs can extract structured facts
  - Keep content factual and quotable (avoid marketing fluff)
  - Update when offerings change
</Accordion>

## Set up ongoing monitoring and maintenance

This is how you ensure continuous SEO and GEO health.

#### Google Search Console (GSC) setup

GSC is your window into what Google sees—indexation status, performance, technical issues. Essential for monitoring SEO health.

Lovable has no built-in GSC integration—manual setup required.

<Accordion title="How to set up and use GCS for monitoring and maintenance">
  **Verify site ownership** (choose one method)

  - DNS TXT record (recommended): add the TXT record in your domain provider’s DNS settings
  - Meta tag verification: prompt Lovable

  > Add GSC verification meta tag: \<meta name='google-site-verification' content='YOUR_CODE' /\> to the \<head\> of my site

  - HTML file upload (if hosting supports): download Google’s verification file and ask Lovable to place it at the site root (usually /public)

  **Submit sitemap**

  1. In GSC, go to **Sitemaps**
  2. Enter your sitemap URL:\
     https://yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml
  3. Click **Submit**

   It can take **24–48 hours** for Google to process and report on it.

  **Use URL Inspection tool** (most powerful feature)

  Use this to:

  - Confirm Google sees real content (not a blank page)
  - Diagnose rendering issues on CSR pages
  - Check if important resources (JS/CSS) are blocked

  For any URL:

  1. Enter the URL in the **URL Inspection** bar
  2. Click **Test Live URL** and w

     ait for Googlebot to fetch and render the page
  6. Click **View Tested Page** to see:
     - Screenshot of what Googleb sees
     - Rendered HTML (content after JavaScript)
     - Console errors
     - Blocked resources
  5. Click **Request Indexing** for new/updated priority pages (rate limited)

  **Reports to monitor weekly**

  - **Coverage/Page indexing:**
    - Indexed vs. excluded pages
    - Crawl errors and reasons for exclusion

  <Accordion title="When is Lovable a good fit for SEO, and when should I consider SSR or prerendering?">
    Lovable handles SEO well for small to medium sites where metadata, internal links, and sitemaps can be maintained manually.

    ### **Good scenarios**

    - Marketing sites & landing pages
    - Startup or business websites
    - Simple blogs or documentation sites (≈ ≤ 200 pages)
    - Portfolios and personal sites
    - Internal tools/dashboards (SEO irrelevant)
    - Apps behind authentication (should not be indexed)
    - Small sites (≈ 5–20 pages) with manageable metadata
    - Projects driven primarily by referrals, social, paid channels, or product-led growth
    - Content-heavy blogs (≈ 50+ articles) — workable with steady upkeep
    - Medium e-commerce sites (hundreds of products) — possible with extra care

    **Why SEO can work here**

    - Pages are limited enough to keep metadata and sitemaps accurate
    - Google can render CSR sites effectively
    - Performance and mobile optimizations are manageable
    - You can manually review what matters: titles, descriptions, schema, OG tags, and internal links

    ### **Poor fit**

    These projects grow large or complex enough that CSR becomes a structural disadvantage.

    - Very large sites (hundreds–thousands of pages, massive e-commerce catalogs, or big content libraries)
    - SEO-dependent businesses where organic search is the primary growth channel
    - Highly competitive or time-sensitive verticals (news/media, finance, legal, etc.)
    - Multilingual/multilocale sites
    - Projects where AI/LLM visibility is mission-critical

    **Why these are challenging**

    - Too many URLs for manual metadata/sitemap upkeep
    - CSR’s second-pass rendering slows indexing
    - Social and AI crawlers don’t execute JavaScript
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When do I need a custom domain?">
    Use a **custom domain** if you care about:

    - Organic search traffic
    - Long-term brand building
    - Competitive SEO
    - Backlink value
    - Full control over technical SEO

    A lovable.app subdomain is fine for:

    - MVPs and d

      emos
    - Temporary landing pages
    - Internal tools
    - Social/paid-driven projects

    For meaningful SEO, a custom domain is the #1 upgrade. See [Custom domains](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/custom-domain) for more information.

  <Accordion title="Can AI search engines (Perplexity, ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude) index Lovable apps?">
    Today, AI crawlers from these systems cannot fully execute JavaScript-rendered content, so they only reliably see the initial HTML.

    The following helps AI crawlers extract facts for their knowledge graphs even without JS execution:

    - Clean semantic HTML with facts in static content
    - Comprehensive schema markup
    - LLM summary page (`/llm`)
    - Quotable content (clear definitions, FAQ format)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often should I update SEO settings, content, and sitemap?">
    - Sitemap → whenever URLs change (at least monthly if active).
    - Metadata (titles/descriptions) → monthly for low-CTR pages.
    - Performance checks (Lighthouse) → monthly.
    - Technical audit → quarterly.
    - Content refreshes → quarterly or when rankings/traffic drop.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is prerendering, and when do I need it?">
    Prerendering/dynamic rendering gives bots a static HTML snapshot while users get the JS app. It’s particularly helpful for:

    - Content-heavy sites
    - Frequent new content
    - SEO-heavy/competitive niches
    - Need for fast indexing
    - Strong AI/LLM visibility

    Lovable doesn’t bundle prerendering, you integrate an external service via your hosting/proxy. For example:

    - [**Prerender.io**](http://Prerender.io): Industry standard, most tested 
    - [**DataJelly**](https://datajelly.app/): Alternative with similar features
    - [**Rendertron**](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/rendertron): Open-source (free, requires hosting)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What are the main CSR SEO limitations, and how do I work around them?">
    - Indexing can be slower than SSR\
      → Submit a sitemap and use URL Inspection.
    - AI crawlers and some bots don’t run JS\
      → Use semantic HTML + schema, consider an LLM summary page.
    - Social previews don’t run JS\
      → Add Open Graph and Twitter Card tags in static HTML.
    - Metadata doesn’t update automatically across routes\
      → Ask Lovable to install react-helmet-async and configure per-route titles/descriptions.
