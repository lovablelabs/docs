  </Accordion>

## Building with Lovable

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I build efficiently with Lovable?">
    Building efficiently with Lovable is all about using the right techniques. Anyone can do it with a bit of practice. To help you get started, check out our [guide](https://mastering-lovable.lovable.app/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How should I structure my prompts for the best results?">
    - Be clear and specific.
    - Focus on one feature at a time.
    - Build incrementally.
    - Use buzz-words for getting the design right.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I do when I hit an error?">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Try-to-fix button">
        Press the Try-to-fix button. Lovable will try to solve the issue automatically. The best part: using the button doesn't deduct any credits!
      </Step>
      <Step title="Investigate">
        If the Try-to-fix button doesn't resolve the issue, you need to ask the AI to investigate the issue. Explain what you are seeing and what specific parts aren't working.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Restore">
        If that doesn’t work, restore to a previous working version. Send a couple of unrelated messages to clear the AI's context and try implementing the same functionality with a different approach. Hopefully the AI understands you better this time.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is refactoring, and why is it important?">
    Refactoring improves code structure and efficiency without altering functionality. It helps:

    - Optimize performance by removing redundancies.
    - Improve maintainability for future updates.
    - Prevent conflicts by structuring logic more clearly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect my project to a backend to store data?">
    You can use Supabase, a backend-as-a-service solution that integrates seamlessly with Lovable. Read more [here](/integrations/supabase).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add login to my website?">
    Yes, you can add authentication by integrating with Supabase. Simply prompt the AI to add it and follow the instructions.

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I store sensitive API keys in Lovable?">
    No! Never enter your API keys directly in Lovable. If you're integrating with an API, we recommend you use Supabase secrets to store your API keys, in combination with the [Supabase Edge Functions](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase).

    \
    If the **restore **function isn’t working, it could be due to one of the following reasons:

    - There’s an **ongoing edit** still in progress.
    - The version you’re trying to restore **contains an error**.
    - The selected version is **identical to the current one**.
    - You have only made changes to backend (SQL/edge functions), the restore button doesn't roll back database changes, therefore it won't be possible to restore to a version which only differs from the current one in the database.

## Managing your account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the email I use to login?">
    Unfortunately, changing the email address directly is not possible at this time. As a workaround, you can create a new account with your desired email address and transfer your projects by following these steps:

    1. Make your existing projects public temporarily and copy the URL.
    2. Access the URL whilst logged in to your new account.
    3. Remix the projects into your new account. Please note that projects connected to Supabase have to be disconnected from Supabase before you can remix them.
    4. Once the projects are transferred, you can make them private again if needed.

    Note: If your target workspace is on a paid plan, remixing public projects may be necessary for access. Remixed projects won’t carry over subscription-level features unless the new workspace has them too.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete my account?">
    To delete your account, please email [**support@lovable.dev**](mailto:support@lovable.dev). All deletion requests must be sent from the email address associated with the account you wish to delete. This is a mandatory security measure to ensure the request is legitimate.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the workspace owner?">
    Yes, an owner can add multiple workspace owners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I transfer project ownership to someone else?">
    One way around this is to remix the project, and the person who remixes the project will now be the owner of that version.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
