## Getting started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is Lovable?">
    Lovable is an AI-powered platform that enables users of any skill level to create full-stack websites through natural language. Simply describe what you want, and Lovable builds it for you.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What can I build with Lovable?">
    If you can imagine it, you can build it with Lovable. From simple landing pages to powerful tools tailored for niche use cases, Lovable gives you the flexibility to create whatever you need, without limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need coding experience to build with Lovable?">
    No. Lovable is designed for all levels of experience. Whether you're a developer or a non-technical user, you can create websites using Lovable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I create a project?">
    To create a project, simply type a message into the message box on the dashboard. Just describe what you want to build and Lovable will take it from there and generate a starting point for your project. Remember to start small and build in increments!
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reuse an existing project?">
    Yes, you can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version.
  </Accordion>

    <!-- New FAQs added below -->
  <Accordion title="Does Lovable support multilingual websites?">
    Yes. You can build multilingual interfaces by using language selectors, a translation JSON file, or by prompting Lovable to generate localized UI text.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Any tips for beginners?">
    - Start with small features rather than full apps.  
    - Always save important prompts for reuse.  
    - Use the Chat mode when stuck.  
    - Break complex tasks into smaller steps.  
    - Preview your website often to catch layout issues early.
  </Accordion>

## Building with Lovable

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I build efficiently with Lovable?">
    Building efficiently with Lovable is all about using the right techniques. Anyone can do it with a bit of practice. To help you get started, check out our [guide](https://mastering-lovable.lovable.app/).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How should I structure my prompts for the best results?">
    - Be clear and specific.
    - Focus on one feature at a time.
    - Build incrementally.
    - Use buzz-words for getting the design right.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What should I do when I hit an error?">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Try-to-fix button">
        Use **Try-to-fix** option. Lovable will try to solve the issue automatically. Using the button doesn't deduct any credits.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Investigate">
        If **Try-to-fix** doesn't resolve the issue, ask the Lovable Agent to investigate the issue. Explain what you are seeing and what specific parts aren't working.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Revert to an older version">
        If that doesn’t work, you can preview an older working version and then revert to that version if needed, or revert and edit a past message to explore a different approach. Nothing gets lost — all changes made after that point stay in the chat and can be reapplied anytime any.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What is refactoring, and why is it important?">
    Refactoring improves code structure and efficiency without altering functionality. It helps:

    - Optimize performance by removing redundancies.
    - Improve maintainability for future updates.
    - Prevent conflicts by structuring logic more clearly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I connect my project to a backend to store data?">
    If you need to add backend capabilities to your application, you can:

    - Connect to Lovable's built-in backend -  [Lovable Cloud](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud)
    - Use Lovable's native [Supabase integration](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add login to my website?">
    Yes, you can add authentication by using [Lovable Cloud](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud) or integrating with [Supabase ](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase). Simply prompt the AI to add it and follow the instructions.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I add third-party APIs to my project?">
    Yes, you can integrate APIs like OpenAI, Stripe, and more by specifying them in your prompt. Read more [here](/integrations/introduction).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I store sensitive API keys in Lovable?">
    No! Never enter your API keys directly in Lovable. If you're integrating with an API, we recommend you use secrets in [Lovable Cloud](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud) or [Supabase](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/supabase) to store your API keys, in combination with their Edge Functions.
  </Accordion>

## Lovable API

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What can I do with the Lovable API?">
    The **Lovable API** makes it possible to create and share Lovable apps programmatically — turning ideas, prompts, or even images into fully-generated applications with a single link. 

    The first release, **Build with URL**, allows you to generate apps directly from a shareable URL. With it, you can:

    - Embed a **Build with Lovable** button on your website or application.
    - Share predefined prompts via URLs with friends, collegues, or on social media.
    - Automate app generation as part of internal workflows.
    - Rapidly prototype apps using URLs with prompts and reference images.

    Learn about the feature and real-world use cases in our announcement post: [Build apps from a link with Lovable Build with URL](https://lovable.dev/blog/introducing-lovable-api-build-with-url).

    Read the full technical guide here: [Lovable API: Build with URL documentation](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/build-with-url).

## Managing your account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the email I use to login?">
    Unfortunately, changing the email address directly is not possible at this time. As a workaround, you can create a new account with your desired email address and transfer your projects by following these steps:

    1. Make your existing projects public temporarily and copy the URL.
    2. Access the URL whilst logged in to your new account.
    3. Remix the projects into your new account. Please note that projects connected to Supabase have to be disconnected from Supabase before you can remix them.
    4. Once the projects are transferred, you can make them private again if needed.

    Note: If your target workspace is on a paid plan, remixing public projects may be necessary for access. Remixed projects won’t carry over subscription-level features unless the new workspace has them too.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete my account?">
    To delete your account, go to **Settings → Your Account**, scroll down and press **Delete account**. This will permanently remove your account and all associated data.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reactivate a deleted account?">
    No, you can't reactivate a deleted account. However, after pressing the button to delete the account, this action can be cancelled within 48 hours to stop the deletion.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I change the workspace owner?">
    Yes, an owner can add multiple workspace owners.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I transfer project ownership to someone else?">
    One way around this is to remix the project, and the person who remixes the project will now be the owner of that version.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
