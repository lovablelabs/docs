<Note>
  When you upgrade your plan, for example, from a 100 credit plan to a 200 credit plan you don’t get 200 new credits.
  Instead, your total credits for the month are updated to 200. So if you already had 100 monthly credits upgrading gives you 100 more, not 200 more.
</Note>

## Credit display
To view how many credits you have or have used, simply press your workspace name on the main dashboard or the project name when inside the project editor. 
You'll see how many credits you have left this billing period, as well as the credit bar. 
The credit bar provides a visual representation of how many credits a user has remaining and how many have been used. 
- **Grey part**: Shows the amount of credits already used this billing period. 
- **Blue parts**: Shows different types of remaining credits. Hovering over each colored section will display a tooltip indicating the credit type and the exact number of credits available for that type.

## Credit usage

Lovable has a usage-based credit system, where sending messages deducts credits. 
The cost of a message depends on its complexity to ensure you only pay for what you actually use. 

Many messages cost less than 1 credit, while more complex ones may cost more. 
This approach allows for more precise edits and greater efficiency per message, making Lovable more affordable overall.

Here are some example prompts and their cost:

| User Prompt                        | Work done                                                         |  Credits used      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Make the button gray               | Changes the button styles                                         | 0.50               |
| Remove the footer                  | Removes the footer component                                      | 0.90               |
| Add authentication                 | Adds login and authentication logic                               | 1.20               |
| Build a landing page with images   | Creates a landing page with generated images, a theme and sections| 2.00               |

## Credit Rollovers

Unused credits automatically roll over at the end of each billing cycle for both monthly and annual paid plans, as long as you keep an active subscription, subject to the limitations outlined below.

**Rollover credit limits:**

- **Monthly plans**: Rollover credits can accumulate up to the monthly credit limit.
- **Annual plans**: Rollover credits can accumulate up to 12 times the monthly credit limit (i.e. the annual limit).
- **Rollover credits expiration:** Rollover credits are valid up to one month after being added for monthly plans, and 12 months after being added for annual plans.
- **Cancellation**: Upon cancellation of a paid subscription, all unused and rollover credits will expire at the end of the current billing period and will not carry over.

<Warning>
  Daily credits do not roll over. Unused daily credits will **not accumulate** from day to day for the free tier or for the paid tiers.
</Warning>
