### Start your project

There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt">
    Lovable’s prompt-based system makes app creation simple.

    - Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box.
    - The more specific you are, the better the results.
    - Start with clear and detailed prompts.
    - You can refine and adjust your project as you go.

    <Info>
      Example:

      _"Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."_
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remix an Existing Project">
    <iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lQeLuBMz1oc?si=ZQoC9sZRDqiMkS8P" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen />

    You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version.

    <Note>
      You can only remix public projects from other users if the project is not connected to Supabase.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Figma">
    If you have a design in Figma,

    1. **Using screenshots:** Take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.
    2. **Using Builder.io integration:** First, structure your Figma design using Auto-Layout and clear layer naming. Then, open the Builder.io plugin in Figma, select your design, and click "Open in Lovable" to generate a fully functional app. [More information here.](https://lovable.dev/blog/2025-01-22-figma-to-lovable-builder-io-native-integration)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using a Sketch">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Use [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/) or any similar tool to sketch your UI.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 2">
        Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 3">
        The platform will transform your sketch into working code.
