### Start your project

There are several ways to get started with Lovable, depending on your preferences and resources:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prompt">
    Lovable’s prompt-based system makes app creation simple.

    - Just describe what you want to build in the prompt box.
    - The more specific you are, the better the results.
    - Start with clear and detailed prompts.
    - You can refine and adjust your project as you go.

    <Info>
      Example:

      _"Create a dashboard with user login, monthly sales in a line chart, and customer demographics in a pie chart."_
    </Info>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Remix an existing project">
    You can remix an existing public project or one of your own. Remixing allows you to reuse the current state of a project as a starting point and build upon it. It’s a great way to explore new ideas, make adjustments, or iterate with different changes while preserving the original version.

    <Note>
      You can only remix public projects from other users if the project is not connected to Supabase.
    </Note>
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using Figma">
    If you have a design in Figma,

    1. **Using screenshots:** Take a screenshot of any part of it. You can paste the screenshot directly into Lovable or drag-and-drop the image file. Once you press Enter, Lovable will convert your design into functional code.
    2. **Using Builder.io integration:** First, structure your Figma design using Auto-Layout and clear layer naming. Then, open the Builder.io plugin in Figma, select your design, and click "Open in Lovable" to generate a fully functional app. See [Figma to Lovable](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/figma-to-lovable) for more information.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Using a sketch">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Use [**Excalidraw**](https://excalidraw.com/) or any similar tool to sketch your UI.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 2">
        Take a screenshot of your drawing, then paste or drag-and-drop it into Lovable. The platform will transform your sketch into working code.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Cloning a website or application">
    If you want to replicate an existing webpage:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Step 1">
        Take a screenshot using shortcuts like _Cmd+Shift+4_ on Mac or tools like the [GoFullPage Chrome Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl).
      </Step>
      <Step title="Step 2">
        Paste or drag the screenshot into Lovable. Lovable will recreate the structure of the webpage in your project.
