When you describe what you want to build, Lovable’s AI writes your code, sets up your backend, and deploys your app automatically. To make this process even smarter, Lovable can connect to your real tools and data sources through something called **Connections** and **MCP Servers**.

These integrations make your AI-assisted builds faster, context-aware, and deeply connected to your real data — all while keeping your deployed apps independent and secure.

## What are connections and MCP servers?

**Connections** let Lovable communicate with third-party tools such as **Notion**, **Linear**, and **Atlassian**, giving the AI access to your real project data, content, and workflows.

If you need more flexibility, you can connect your own systems using an **MCP Server (Model Context Protocol)**, which acts as a secure bridge between Lovable’s AI and your internal APIs or databases.

In short:

- **Connections** are prebuilt integrations with popular third-party apps and services.
- **MCP Servers** are custom integrations for your private or proprietary tools.

### Example capabilities

- Fetch content from Notion to auto-generate app content
- Map Linear or Jira issues into live dashboards
- Pull real-time analytics from your internal API via an MCP Server.
- Connect design or content assets from Google Drive or other sources.

## How these work inside Lovable

When you connect a tool or MCP Server, you grant the Lovable AI permission to perform specific actions in that tool — for example, reading data, creating tasks, or updating content. This enables your projects to access that data and functionality directly within Lovable.

By combining AI generation with real data access, Lovable builds apps that are both **accurate** and **immediately usable**.

Here’s what that looks like:

| **You ask Lovable to…**                                    | **What the AI does**                                                                              |
| :--------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| “Build a feature board that syncs with our Linear issues.” | Uses your Linear connection to map real issue data into your app’s database and UI automatically. |
| “Create a wiki using our Notion workspace.”                | Reads your Notion database structure and generates editable page templates.                       |
| “Add an analytics dashboard using our internal API.”       | Connects to your MCP Server, detects endpoints, and builds a live data visualization.             |

### Practical use cases

| Role / Goal         | Example                                                      | Result                                           |
| :------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| **Product Manager** | Connect Linear and Jira to build live sprint dashboards.     | Real-time visibility into team progress.         |
| **Designer**        | Sync with Notion design docs to auto-generate UI components. | Auto-generated UI matching your design system.   |
| **Engineer**        | Add an MCP Server to pull analytics from your internal API.  | Live dashboards powered by private data.         |
| **Marketing**       | Connect Notion or Drive to auto-publish campaign pages.      | Campaign pages stay synced automatically.        |
| **Automation**      | Use Zapier or custom MCP workflows.                          | Trigger cross-app actions directly from Lovable. |

## How to add a prebuilt connection

To use prebuilt integrations with popular third-party apps and services:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Connections**
2. **Select a service**\
   Choose the app you want to integrate, such as Notion, Linear, or Atlassian.
3. Click **Connect**\
   Sign in and grant Lovable access to your account. Once connected, you can interact with the service through AI commands:
   - “Create a new Linear issue titled _Update onboarding flow_.”
   - “Add a Notion page for our Q4 marketing roadmap.”
   - “Show Jira tickets assigned to me this week.”

## How to add an MCP server

If your team has developed a custom integration, you can add it through the MCP server option.

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Connections** and scroll to the bottom of the list.
2. Select **Add MCP Server.**  
3. **Enter server details:**
   - **Server name:** A clear name for your server (for example, _Internal CRM_ or _Analytics API_).
   - **Server URL:** The address where Lovable can reach your MCP server.
   - **Authentication:** Add any Bearer token or API key if required.
6. Click **Add server** \
   The MCP Server now appears alongside other connections, allowing the AI to access and use it like any other service.

## **Security and permissions**

Lovable’s integrations and MCP Servers use permission-based access. You have full control over which tools are connected and what data can be accessed. Connections can be modified or removed anytime from **Settings → Connections**.
