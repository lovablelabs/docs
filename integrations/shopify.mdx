From selling physical products to digital downloads, Lovable helps you build, customize, and iterate your store using natural language, while Shopify handles payments, inventory, and logistics when you go live.

## Use cases

With Lovable + Shopify, you can launch real online stores for:

- **Physical products**: sell clothes, gadgets, accessories, or home goods
- **Digital products**: offer e-books, courses, music, or software downloads
- **Niche brands**: quickly spin up stores for limited-edition merch, local products, dropshipping or side projects
- **Small businesses**: showcase bakeries, coffee shops, or craft businesses and accept orders online
- **Testing new product ideas**: add a few products and evaluate performance before full-scale production
- **Business expansion**: introduce new collections, seasonal campaigns, or bundles with just a prompt

## Shopify integration setup notes

Before you start building your eCommerce store with **Lovable + Shopify**, here are a few important things to know:

- **Sandbox store for testing:**\
  Lovable automatically creates a sandbox store so you can build and experiment safely for free. This environment is perfect for setup and testing, but it **won’t process real payments**.
- **Claiming your store:**\
  When you’re ready to go live, you’ll need to **claim your store**. This migrates it to your Shopify account and starts a **30-day free Shopify trial**. In Shopify, you need to activate payments and complete your store setup to start accepting real payments from your customers.
- **Required Shopify subscription:**\
  After the free trial period, you’ll need a **paid Shopify plan** to continue selling products online. This subscription is managed **directly through Shopify** and is **separate from Lovable pricing**.
- **Shopify review policy compliance:**\
  Before publishing your store, make sure all reviews are **authentic, unbiased, and compliant with** [Shopify's Review Policy](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/help-support/faq/reviews).

## Create your sandbox store

1. Tell Lovable what type of store you want to create and mention you want to build it with Shopify. For example:

   > Create an eCommerce store with Shopify for selling handmade scented candles.
2. Lovable prompts you to enable the Shopify connection. Press **Allow**. \
   Lovable automatically creates a **sandbox store,** which won't accept real payments.

   Now, you can create, update, and delete your products immediately directly from Lovable. You can build your storefront as long as you want before claiming your store on Shopify.

## Edit your store

Now you can add your products and product images.

### Add products

Start by adding products with a **name, description, and price**. For example:

> Add a product named _Lavender Breeze Candle_ with the description _A calming handmade soy candle infused with lavender essential oils_ and the price _\$25_.

Click **Allow** to create a Shopify product and add it to your store. You can edit details later.\
If your product doesn’t appear, prompt:

> Display the products on the website.

### Add product images

Ensure that you use representative images of your product at all times. Add visuals using any of these options:

**Generate with AI**

> Add an AI-generated image to the product _Lavender Breeze Candle_.

**Upload or attach your own image**

> Add the attached image to the product _Lavender Breeze Candle_.

**Use image from URL**

> Add image from URL to the product _Lavender Breeze Candle_.

## Manage your store

Manage your products and refine your store without leaving Lovable. For example, you can tell Lovable to:

- Update product descriptions or prices
- Change product names
- Remove products
- Display all products

> “Update the price of _Lavender Breeze Candle_ to _\$28_.”\
> “Change the description of _Vanilla Bean Candle_ to highlight the wooden wick.”

## Claim your store

When you’re ready to go live with your store, **claim your store** to migrate it to Shopify and start a **30-day free Shopify trial**, followed by a required Shopify subscription.

> Claim the store.

Lovable prompts you to claim the store. Press **Claim** and input your email address. Shopify sends a claim link to your email address. To accept the invitation, log in with your Shopify ID or create a new one. You will receive an email confirming that you are the store owner.

Now, you can start accepting real payments for your e-commerce store. After the free trial, you need to get a paid Shopify subscription to continue selling products online. Shopify offers low starting fees (for example, \$1/month in the US for the first 3 months).

<Warning>
  Only claim your store when you are fully ready to launch as you need a paid Shopify subscription  after the 30-day free trial to continue selling products online.
</Warning>

## Launch your store

1. Publish your Lovable project and share it with the world.
2. Go to your Shopify account and follow their instructions to enable payments.
