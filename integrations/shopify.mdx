## Use Cases

With Lovable + Shopify you can build and run real online stores, such as:

- **Launch niche brand stores** ‚Äî quickly spin up shops for limited-edition merch, local products, dropshipping or side projects.
- **Run a small business storefront** ‚Äî showcase your bakery, coffee shop, or craft business online and accept orders.

## Important: Sandbox Store

When you first start, Lovable automatically creates a **sandbox store**.\
This store is meant for experimenting and making setup easy. You can build your store around it, but it won‚Äôt accept real payments.

üëâ To start accepting payments and make your store public, you‚Äôll need to **claim your store**. At that point, it will migrate to your Shopify account and start a 30-day free trial.

<Warning>
  Ensure there are no made up reviews on your store before you publish. Reviews are meant to be unbiased, useful, and trustworthy. If you are unsure, please review [Shopify's Review Policy](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/help-support/faq/reviews). 
</Warning>
