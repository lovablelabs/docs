From selling physical products to digital downloads, Lovable helps you build, customize, and iterate your store using natural language, while Shopify handles payments, inventory, and logistics when you go live.

## Use cases

With Lovable + Shopify, you can launch real online stores for:

- **Physical products**: sell clothes, gadgets, accessories, or home goods
- **Digital products**: offer e-books, courses, music, or software downloads
- **Niche brands**: quickly spin up stores for limited-edition merch, local products, dropshipping or side projects
- **Small businesses**: showcase bakeries, coffee shops, or craft businesses and accept orders online
- **Testing new product ideas**: add a few products and evaluate performance before full-scale production
- **Business expansion**: introduce new collections, seasonal campaigns, or bundles with just a prompt

## Important: Sandbox Store

When you first start, Lovable automatically creates a **sandbox store**.\
This store is meant for experimenting and making setup easy. You can build your store around it, but it won‚Äôt accept real payments.

üëâ To start accepting payments and make your store public, you‚Äôll need to **claim your store**. At that point, it will migrate to your Shopify account and start a 30-day free trial.

<Warning>
  Ensure there are no made up reviews on your store before you publish. Reviews are meant to be unbiased, useful, and trustworthy. If you are unsure, please review [Shopify's Review Policy](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/help-support/faq/reviews).
</Warning>
