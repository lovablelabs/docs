From selling physical products to digital downloads, Lovable helps you build, customize, and iterate your store using natural language, while Shopify handles payments, inventory, and logistics when you go live.

## Use cases

With Lovable + Shopify, you can launch real online stores for:

- **Physical products**: sell clothes, gadgets, accessories, or home goods
- **Digital products**: offer e-books, courses, music, or software downloads
- **Niche brands**: quickly spin up stores for limited-edition merch, local products, dropshipping or side projects
- **Small businesses**: showcase bakeries, coffee shops, or craft businesses and accept orders online
- **Testing new product ideas**: add a few products and evaluate performance before full-scale production
- **Business expansion**: introduce new collections, seasonal campaigns, or bundles with just a prompt

## Before you begin

Before you start building your eCommerce store with **Lovable + Shopify**, here are a few important things to know:

- **Sandbox store - free for testing**\
  Lovable automatically creates a sandbox store so you can build and experiment safely for free. This environment is perfect for setup and testing, but it **won’t process real payments**.
- **Claiming your store**\
  When you’re ready to launch your store, you’ll need to **claim your store**. This migrates it to your Shopify account and starts a **30-day free Shopify trial**. In Shopify, you need to activate payments and complete your store setup to start accepting real payments from your customers.
- **Required Shopify subscription**\
  After the free trial period, you’ll need a **paid Shopify plan** to continue selling products online. This subscription is managed **directly through Shopify** and is **separate from Lovable pricing**.
- **Shopify review policy compliance**\
  Before publishing your store, make sure all reviews are **authentic, unbiased, and compliant with** [**Shopify’s Review Policy**](https://help.shopify.com/en/partners/help-support/faq/reviews).

## Shopify integration flow

You can start by:

- Creating a new project
- Remixing an existing project. Find Lovable + Shopify templates here:

### 1. Create your store

**When creating a new project from scratch**, tell Lovable what type of store you want to create and specify Shopify.

> Create an eCommerce store with Shopify for selling handmade scented candles.

**When remixing an existing project**, prompt Lovable to integrate Shopify and remove mock data. It is important to use a good, comprehensive prompt. For example:

> I would like to replace the products in this store with my own products and create my Shopify store. Please proceed to: 
>
> 1. Connect to Shopify \
> 2. Remove all mock product data from the store and create new X products with product images \
> 3. Update the Product cards and Product details page to use the new product information \
> 4. Update the product details page URL to match the new product \
> 5. Update the add to wishlist component and logic to match this change \
> 6. Update my cart, buy now CTA, and any related checkout actions on any page to reflect Shopify store integration

Lovable will prompt you to **enable the Shopify connection** — just click **Allow**.\
Your sandbox store is ready for setup.

### 2. Add products and product images

Start by adding products with a **name, description, and price**. For example:

> “Add a product named _Lavender Breeze Candle_, description: ‘A calming handmade soy candle infused with lavender essential oils,’ price: \$25.”

Click **Allow** to create a Shopify product and add it to your store. You can edit details later.\
If your product doesn’t appear, prompt:

> Display the products on the website.

Then, enhance your listings with visuals using any of the below options. Always use representative images.

- **Generate AI images**
- **Upload or attach your own image**
- **Add image from URL**

### 3. Manage your store

Manage your products and refine your store without leaving Lovable. For example, you can tell Lovable to:

- Update product descriptions or prices
- Change product names
- Remove products
- Display all products
- Add percentage or USD amount based discounts, and include the discount code validity period
- Add and share wishlist

> Update the price of _Lavender Breeze Candle_ to _\$28_.\
> Change the description of _Vanilla Bean Candle_ to highlight the wooden wick.\
> Remove the product _Cinnamon Spice Candle_.\
> Display all products.\
> Create a 15% discount code for the product _Lavender Breeze Candle_. The code should be LAVANDER15 and valid until the end of November 2025.\
> Allow me to add products to the wishlist and share it.

### 4. Claim your store

When ready to go live:

1. Type "Claim the store". Lovable prompts you to claim the store. Press **Claim**.
2. Enter your email address, then accept the claim link from Shopify. Log in with your Shopify ID or create a new one. You will receive an email confirming that you are the store owner.
4. Activate payments in Shopify and complete your store setup to begin selling.

When you claim your store, Shopify assigns a permanent domain for your shop - But don't worry, that's just your backend. [**Your real store URL will be your lovable.app or your custom domain.**](http://lovable.app)

<Warning>
  Only claim your store when you are fully ready to launch as you need a paid Shopify subscription  after the 30-day free trial to continue selling products online.
</Warning>

### 5. Launch your store

When your store is claimed and your setup complete, publish your Lovable project and share your store with the world!

You can:

- Add new products anytime via Lovable
- Manage prices and descriptions dynamically
- Launch new collections, promotions, or bundles instantly with a prompt
