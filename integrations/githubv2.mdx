When you build with Lovable, your code lives inside the platform — perfect for most creators.\
But if you want your own copy, plan to work with developers, or move your project elsewhere, you can export and sync everything with GitHub in just a few clicks.

## What is GitHub

GitHub is a cloud-based platform for storing, managing, and sharing code. It keeps track of every change, supports collaboration, and integrates with popular deployment tools like Vercel and Netlify. Think of it as **Google Drive for code**, built for developers.

## Why connect GitHub to Lovable

Use the GitHub integration when you want to:

- **Keep a personal backup** — Store your code safely outside of Lovable
- **Collaborate with developers** — Give your team direct access to the code
- **Migrate your project** — Move your Lovable project to another platform or workflow

<Note>
  You don’t need GitHub to use Lovable — many creators build and launch entirely within the platform.
</Note>

## Before you connect

Make sure you understand how the integration works:

- **GitHub account required** — Create one for free at [github.com](https://github.com)
- **Single source of truth** — When connected, your code lives in GitHub, not separately in Lovable
- **Two-way sync** — Changes made in Lovable appear in GitHub, and vice versa
- **Stable repo path** — The connection depends on the exact GitHub repository location (same name, organization, and account)

<Warning>
  Don’t rename, move, or delete your GitHub repository after connecting. Doing so will break the sync, and Lovable won’t be able to update your project.
</Warning>

## How to connect your GitHub account and project to GitHub

Follow these steps to export your Lovable project:

1. Go to project settings - GitHub, and click Connect GitHub (Admin)
1. Sign in to GitHub
1. Connect project
1. Link your workspace to GitHub - add organizations - i**nstall and authorize** [lovable.dev](http://lovable.dev)
5. Choose which GitHub organization or account should store your code and click **Continue**.
6. Connect project  - click **Connect**
7. Click Transfer anwyay to confirm transfer to set up 2-way sync. \
   A GitHub repository is now under your account.
1. In your Lovable project editor, click the GitHub icon in the top-right corner.
2. Select Connect GitHub. You’ll be redirected to your project’s GitHub settings.
3. Click Connect GitHub again to start the authorization process.
4. Log into GitHub and authorize the Lovable app to access your repositories.
5. Choose which GitHub organization or account should store your code.
6. Click Transfer Anyway to complete the export. Your code is now live on GitHub!

## After connecting

Once the connection is established:

- Your code is stored in your GitHub account or organization
- Updates in Lovable and GitHub stay in sync automatically
- You can clone, download, or edit your code anytime
- You can share your repository with collaborators or developers

---

## Disconnecting GitHub

You can disconnect your Lovable project from GitHub at any time in your project’s **GitHub settings**.

When you disconnect:

- The bidirectional sync between Lovable and GitHub stops
- Your GitHub repository remains intact with all its history and files
- Your code is stored exclusively within Lovable

If you reconnect later:

- A new GitHub repository is created with your latest Lovable code
- Your original repository remains on GitHub but is no longer linked to Lovable

## Working with branches (Labs feature)

Advanced users can enable **GitHub branch switching** from\
**Settings → Account → Labs → GitHub branch switching.”**

Branches let you test or develop features safely before merging changes to your live project.\
Learn more in the [Labs features](/features/labs) page.

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if I rename or move my GitHub repository?">
    The connection will break. Restore the repository to its original location and name to fix it.\
    If deleted, you can [restore it on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/restoring-a-deleted-repository).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I rename my GitHub username or organization?">
    Renaming your GitHub account or organization will break the connection.\
    Revert to the original name to restore sync with Lovable.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Clicking 'Connect GitHub' does nothing — what’s wrong?">
    Your browser probably blocked the GitHub login popup.\
    Allow popups for Lovable, then try again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to know GitHub to use this feature?">
    Not at all. Just connect and authorize — GitHub will safely store your code.\
    Advanced GitHub features are optional.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I disconnect from GitHub?">
    Yes — you can disconnect at any time in your project’s GitHub settings.\
    Your repository stays on GitHub, but syncing stops.\
    If you reconnect later, a new repository is created.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I import an existing GitHub repo into Lovable?">
    Not currently. You can only export from Lovable to GitHub, not the other way around.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How can I switch to a different GitHub account?">
    You can’t change the linked GitHub account once connected.\
    To use another, create a new Lovable project and connect it fresh.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="The repo ended up in the wrong organization — can I move it?">
    Not directly. Try this workaround:

    1. **Remix your project** to create a new copy.
    2. **Connect the new project** to GitHub.
    3. Choose the correct organization during setup.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Lovable can’t access my repository — what should I do?">
    You’ve likely renamed, moved, or deleted the repo.\
    Restore or revert any changes to the repo’s name, path, or owner.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Why don’t my commits appear in Lovable?">
    Lovable only syncs the **default branch** (usually `main`).\
    Merge your branch into `main` or [switch branches](/features/labs) inside Lovable.
  </Accordion>
