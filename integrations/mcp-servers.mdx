**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that connects AI systems, like Lovable, to external tools, services, and data sources. In Lovable, MCP servers are used as **personal connectors**.

By connecting Lovable to tools such as Notion, Atlassian, or Linear, the Lovable Agent can use real team context to generate more accurate code, prototypes, and documentation.

When connected, Lovable can read structured data (like text from docs, issues, or diagrams) and, where supported, perform limited actions such as creating or updating items.

Lovable includes several prebuilt personal connectors on all plans, with support for custom MCP servers on Business and Enterprise.

## Why use personal connectors

Personal connectors unlock two key capabilities:

- **Bring your existing context into Lovable.**\
  The Lovable Agent can read your team’s documentation, tickets, and design files to build prototypes and flows aligned with your standards.
- **Connect your Lovable apps to your workflows.**\
  The Lovable Agent can take follow-up actions in your connected tools, such as updating ticket statuses, adding prototype links as comments, or creating new items when supported.

Lovable becomes more powerful when it understands your team’s world, eliminating guesswork, speeding up iteration, and helping you go from **idea to live app faster than ever.**

### How to add a prebuilt personal connector

To use prebuilt integrations with popular third-party apps and services:

1. Go to **Settings → Connectors → Personal connectors**.
2. **Select a personal connector** (for example, Notion or Linear).
3. Click **Connect**. Sign in and grant Lovable access to your account.

In addition to these steps, you need to do the following in **n8n** and **Miro**:

[n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/accessing-n8n-mcp-server)

- Go to **Settings → MCP access** and toggle **Enable MCP access** (requires instance owner or admin permissions)
- For each workflow you want to expose, go to **Settings** in the workflow editor and toggle **Available in MCP.**

**Miro Enterprise**

- Register your interest for Miro's MCP beta program, see [Miro MCP](https://miro.com/ai/mcp/).

## Custom MCP servers (Business and Enterprise)

For full flexibility, you can connect **custom MCP servers** as personal connectors to bring internal or third-party systems into Lovable. This is perfect for private APIs, internal CRMs, or custom data sources.

Explore [remote MCP servers](https://mcpservers.org/remote-mcp-servers), a curated list of high-quality remote MCP servers compatible with Lovable.

### How to connect a custom MCP server

To connect a custom or internal MCP server:

1. Go to **Settings → Connectors → Personal connectors.**
2. Click **New MCP server**.
3. **Server name**: Enter a clear name for your server (for example, _Internal CRM_ or _Analytics API_).
4. **Server URL**: Enter the address where Lovable can reach your MCP server.
5. **Authentication:**
   - **OAuth (default):** Lovable uses OAuth by default. After you click **Add & authorize**, you’ll be prompted to authorize.
   - **Bearer token or API key:** For servers that don't support OAuth, you can authenticate using a bearer token or API key.
   - **No authentication**: Connect without credentials if the server doesn't require authentication.
6. **Add server**. The custom MCP server now appears in your list of personal connectors and can provide contextual data for builds.

## Practical examples

Each connected app instantly becomes available as context for the Lovable Agent. You can interact with connected tools using natural prompts.

| **Scenario**                                          | **Example prompt**                                               | **Example outcome**                                                                                                    |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A **product manager** connects **Linear** or **Jira** | _Generate a prototype based on tickets in the current sprint._   | Lovable reads issue descriptions and acceptance criteria to build aligned, testable UI.                                |
| A **marketer** links **Notion** or **Confluence**     | _Turn our Q4 campaign brief into a landing page._                | Lovable uses the document as context to generate an on-brand, editable page.                                           |
| A **designer** connects **Miro**                      | _Prototype the signup flow from our whiteboard._                 | Lovable reads flow diagrams to scaffold UI navigation and turns them into an interactive prototype your team can test. |
| An **engineer** links **n8n** or **internal MCP**     | _Build a workflow UI that lists users and allows deleting them._ | Lovable builds an app that uses live data and workflows.                                                               |

## Security and permissions

Personal connectors (MCP server connections) are **per-user connections**. You can review or revoke them anytime in **Settings → Connectors**.

For quick access inside a project, click `+` in the prompt box and go to **Connectors**.

On **Business** and **Enterprise** plans, workspace **admins and owners** can manage which servers are available as personal connectors for all users:

- Go to **Settings → Privacy & security** to enable or disable all **MCP server access** for the entire workspace.
- Go to **Settings → Connectors → Personal connectors → Admin settings** to enable or disable individual MCP servers as personal connectors.
