**MCP (Model Context Protocol)** is an open standard that connects AI systems, like Lovable, to external tools, services, and data sources.

By connecting Lovable to tools such as Notion, Atlassian, or Linear, the Lovable Agent can use real team context to generate more accurate code, prototypes, and documentation.

When you connect an MCP server, Lovable can read structured data (like text from docs, issues, or diagrams) and, where supported, perform limited actions such as creating or updating items.

Lovable includes several prebuilt MCP servers on all plans, with the option to add custom ones on Business and Enterprise plans.

## Why connect MCP servers

In Lovable, MCP servers unlock two key capabilities:

- **Bring your existing context into Lovable.**\
  The Lovable Agent can read your team’s documentation, tickets, and design files to build prototypes and flows aligned with your standards.
- **Connect your Lovable apps to your workflows.**\
  The Lovable Agent can take follow-up actions in your connected tools — such as updating ticket statuses, adding prototype links as comments, or creating new items when supported.

Lovable becomes more powerful when it understands your team’s world — eliminating guesswork, speeding up iteration, and helping you go from **idea to live app faster than ever.**

### How to connect a prebuilt MCP server

To use prebuilt integrations with popular third-party apps and services:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → MCP servers**.
2. **Select an MCP server** (for example, Notion, Linear, or Atlassian).
3. Click **Connect**. Sign in and grant Lovable access to your account.

In addition to these steps, you need to do the following in [n8n](https://docs.n8n.io/advanced-ai/accessing-n8n-mcp-server):

- Go to **Settings → MCP access** and toggle **Enable MCP access** (requires instance owner or admin permissions)
- For each workflow you want to expose, go to **Settings** in the workflow editor and toggle **Available in MCP.**

## Custom MCP servers (Business & Enterprise)

For full flexibility, you can connect **custom MCP servers** to bring internal or third-party systems into Lovable — perfect for private APIs, internal CRMs, or custom data sources.

Explore [remote MCP servers](https://mcpservers.org/remote-mcp-servers), a curated list of high-quality remote MCP servers compatible with Lovable.

### How to connect a custom MCP server

To connect a custom or internal MCP server:

1. Go to **Settings → Integrations → Your MCP servers.**
2. Click **Set up** next to **New MCP server**.
3. **Enter server details:**
   - **Server name**: A clear name for your server (for example, _Internal CRM_ or _Analytics API_).
   - **Server URL**: The address where Lovable can reach your MCP server.
4. **Authentication:**
   - **OAuth (default):** Lovable uses OAuth by default. After you click **Add server**, you’ll be prompted to authorize.
   - **Bearer token or API key:** If the MCP server doesn't support OAuth, expand **Advanced settings** and enter a **bearer token or API key**. When provided, Lovable will use this to authenticate requests instead of OAuth.
4. Click **Add server**.\
   The custom MCP server now appears in your list and can provide contextual data for builds.

## Practical examples

Each connected app instantly becomes available as context for the Lovable Agent. You can interact with connected tools using natural prompts.

| **Scenario**                                          | **Example prompt**                                               | **Example outcome**                                                                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A **product manager** connects **Linear** or **Jira** | _Generate a prototype based on tickets in the current sprint._   | Lovable reads issue descriptions and acceptance criteria to build aligned, testable UI. |
| A **marketer** links **Notion** or **Confluence**     | _Turn our Q4 campaign brief into a landing page._                | Lovable uses the document as context to generate an on-brand, editable page.            |
| An **engineer** links **n8n** or **internal MCP**     | _Build a workflow UI that lists users and allows deleting them._ | Lovable builds an app that uses live data and workflows.                                |

## Security and permissions

MCP server connections are **user-based and personal**. You can review or revoke connections anytime in **Settings → Integrations**.

For quick access on project level, click `+` in the prompt box and go to **Integrations**.

/>

On **Business** and **Enterprise** plans, workspace **admins and owners** can manage which servers are available for all users:

- Go to **Settings → Privacy & Security** to enable or disable all MCP server access for the entire workspace.
- Go to **Settings → Integrations → Manage servers** to enable or disable individual MCP servers.
