## What is Make?

![Make website](/images/make-hero.png)

[Make](https://www.make.com) is a powerful no-code automation platform that lets you visually build workflows across apps, APIs, and data sources.

Instead of writing backend logic, you drag, drop, and connect modules in a flowchart-style canvas. Itâ€™s ideal for:

- **Non-developers** who want automation without writing code
- **Developers** who want fast prototyping or extendability via APIs
- **Teams** looking to connect tools like Slack, Airtable, Notion, Calendly, Supabase, and more

With Make, you can:

- **Trigger actions** from your Lovable app (e.g., when a button is clicked)
- **Send and receive data** via webhooks and APIs
- **Connect with 1,500\+ tools** or custom APIs
- **Automate** tasks like emailing, AI calling, enrichment, and reminders

## Why use Make with Lovable?

In this below tutorial, Make acts as your **AI-enabled backend**, while Lovable powers the frontend. The result: a custom CRM, built in minutes, fully automated.

This setup is ideal for:

- Non-developers needing advanced logic
- Sales teams with evolving workflows
- Fast iteration without backend overhead
- API-powered automations with real-time UI responses

### What we'll build

You're going to create a CRM with three core data models:

- **Deals** (with stage-based tracking)

- **Companies** (with enrichable data)

Each entity interacts with automations via Make. By the end, youâ€™ll be able to:

- Move a deal and trigger an email
- Click a contact and start an AI sales call
- Click a company and fetch real-time data
- Secure everything via Supabase Edge Functions

### How are we going to build it?

Building your own CRM can take months. With **Lovable** and **Make**, you can ship one in under an hour â€” and automate the entire sales workflow without writing backend code. In this step-by-step guide, youâ€™ll learn how to build a **fully functional, AI-powered CRM**, complete with:

- Visual deal pipelines (drag-and-drop)
- Editable contact and company modals

          2. Real new step \> send the domain as JSON to following webhook: [Link]
          3. You will receive a webhook response as JSOn and you need to dynamically parse this into the modal view so create dynamic fields.
        </Info>
      </Step>
      <Step title="Call Apollo.io API">
        ![Apollo Make Lovable Pn](/images/apollo-make-lovable.png)
