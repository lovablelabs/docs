## **What Perplexity enables**

The Perplexity connector brings **AI search with citations** directly into your Lovable apps. Your app can now:

- Answer questions using _live information_
- Provide concise summaries with verifiable sources
- Compare companies, products, or markets in real time
- Reduce hours of manual Googling into seconds

Perplexity is ideal for apps that need trustworthy, recent information.

## **Common use cases**

- **Sales prep assistants**\
  Pull company overviews, recent news, and risk flags before every call.
- **Competitor and market research tools**\
  Summaries of funding, launches, leadership changes, and positioning.
- **Regulatory or policy trackers**\
  Monitor new rulings or compliance updates based on fresh sources.
- **Fact-checkers (“Is this true?”)**\
  Paste a claim → get a truth rating + supporting/contradicting sources.

## **Example app workflows**

- Run multiple Perplexity queries in parallel (e.g., news, funding, hires).
- Generate dashboards and reports with timestamped results.
- Export responses as Markdown or push into Supabase.

## **Configuration**

In **Workspace Settings → Integrations → Connectors**:

1. Select **Perplexity**
2. Add your API key
3. Save → connector becomes available to all projects in the workspace
