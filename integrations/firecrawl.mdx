  Firecrawl is free to use through Lovable until Jan 31, 2026.

[Firecrawl](https://www.firecrawl.dev/) is a web scraping and crawling platform that lets your Lovable app work with **live website data**. It’s designed for apps that need to continuously fetch, update, and structure information from websites, rather than relying on one-time imports or static datasets.

With Firecrawl, your app can:

- Scrape URLs into structured JSON
- Crawl entire websites, including sitemaps, subpages, and navigation
- Extract clean text, metadata, product details, tables, and more
- Handle JavaScript-heavy sites, lazy loading, and cookie modals
- Re-fetch live data on a schedule to keep results up to date

Firecrawl is a good fit when your app depends on **real-time or frequently changing website content**.

## How to connect Firecrawl

Connecting Firecrawl is a **two-way setup** between Firecrawl and Lovable.

You can create multiple Firecrawl connections using different API keys, which is useful for separating environments (for example, development and production) or managing rate limits.

### Prerequisites

Before connecting Firecrawl, make sure you have:

- A Firecrawl account and API key
- Lovable workspace owner or admin role

### 1. Create a Firecrawl account and API key

You can create multiple API keys in Firecrawl. This is useful for different environments or rate limits.

To create a Firecrawl API key:

1. Go to https://www.firecrawl.dev/ and set up your account.
2. Go to your Firecrawl dashboard and navigate to the [**API Keys page**](https://www.firecrawl.dev/app/api-keys)**.**
3. Click **Create.**
4. Give your key a descriptive name (for example, `Lovable integration`).
5. Copy the generated API key and store it securely.

   <Info>
     Your API key functions like a password. Keep it secure and never share it publicly. You’ll need it in the next step.
   </Info>

Firecrawl provides free credits when you sign up, which is enough to test your connection and complete this setup.

### 2. Connect Firecrawl to Lovable

Workspace **admins** and **owners** can connect Firecrawl. When the connection is created, Firecrawl becomes available across all projects in the workspace.

You can create multiple connections using different API keys. This is useful for different environments or rate limits.

To connect Firecrawl:

1. Go to **Settings → Connectors → Shared connectors** and select **Firecrawl**.
2. Click **Add connection**.
3. **Display name**: name the connection, for example `Firecrawl Prod` .
5. Under **Authentication**, choose one of the following:
   - **Managed by Lovable**: Lovable provides and manages the Firecrawl credentials for you.

     <Tip>
       Firecrawl is free to use through Lovable until Jan 31, 2026 if you choose Managed by Lovable.
     </Tip>
   - **Your own credentials**: Use your own Firecrawl API key (`fc-xxxxxxxx…`).
5. Click **Create**.

When connected, your Lovable apps can start using Firecrawl to scrape, crawl, and keep website data up to date.
