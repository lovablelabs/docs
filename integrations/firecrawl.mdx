## **What Firecrawl enables**

Firecrawl makes your app capable of:

- Scraping URLs into structured JSON
- Crawling entire sites (site maps, subpages, navigation)
- Extracting clean text, metadata, product info, tables, and more
- Handling JS-heavy sites, lazy loading, and cookie modals
- Pulling live data repeatedly (“sync and update”)

> **Firecrawl is free to use through Lovable until Jan 31, 2025.**

This removes scraping as a technical bottleneck entirely.

## **Common use cases**

- **Competitor trackers**\
  Monitor pricing, product pages, or feature announcements.
- **Jobs aggregators**\
  Pull listings from Greenhouse, Lever, Workday, etc.
- **Lead enrichment tools**\
  Crawl a company’s full domain → extract team, tech stack, contact info.
- **E-commerce price trackers**\
  Scrape products and detect price changes over time.
- **Brand asset extractors**\
  Get fonts, colors, logos, and style tokens from any website.

## **Example app workflows**

- Submit a URL → Firecrawl returns structured JSON
- Crawl entire domains for mapping or discovery
- Extract product lists, documentation, or blog posts
- Track updates over time with “sync and get an update”
- Trigger downstream automation (e.g., send price-drop alerts)
-
