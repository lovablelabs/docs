Lovable integrates with a wide range of tools and platforms. There are three types of integrations, each serving a different purpose in how you build and run apps with Lovable.

## Lovable integrations overview

<Info>
  **What is an API?**\
  API (Application Programming Interface) is a structured way for services or applications to communicate and share data with each other. It defines what you can ask for, what you’ll get back, and how to make the request.

## Shared connectors:  Add capabilities to your published app

Shared connectors are the easiest way to extend the power of your Lovable app. They act like plug-ins that your app can call whenever it needs to perform an action or fetch data.

Shared connectors are ideal when your **deployed app** needs to interact with external services to gain operational capabilities.

### Examples and use cases

- [Lovable Cloud](/integrations/cloud): providing built-in backend services, authentication, database, and full-stack hosting
- [Lovable AI](/integrations/ai): powering your app with advanced AI capabilities
- [**Stripe**](/integrations/stripe): handling payments or subscriptions
- [**Shopify**](/integrations/shopify): managing ecommerce operations
- [**Supabase**](/integrations/supabase): authenticating users and storing data

  <Tip>
    When you need backend functionality, such as authentication, database, and storage, use [Lovable Cloud](/features/cloud), our built-in full-stack hosting platform.
  </Tip>

### Key characteristics

- Configured once by admins at the workspace level
- Available to everyone in your workspace and reusable across all projects
- Provide functional capabilities your app can call while in use
- Managed in **Settings → Connectors → Shared connectors**

## **Personal connectors:  Provide context during app creation**

[Personal connectors (MCP servers)](/integrations/mcp-servers) give the Lovable Agent access to content and artifacts inside the tools you already use, **during app creation**. They provide context so the agent can build apps that reflect your real workflows.

Use personal connectors when your app should be created using the real content your organization already relies on.

### **Examples and use cases**

- **Linear:** importing issues and specs to generate features
- **Notion:** referencing docs and pages to guide app behavior
- **Atlassian (Jira and Confluence):** aligning with tickets, roadmaps, and documentation
- **Miro:** acccessing your Miro boards and diagrams to generate interactive prototypes
- **n8n:** mirroring or plugging into existing automation workflows
- **Custom MCP servers:** connecting internal or third-party systems

### **Key characteristics**

- Connect personal tool accounts to provide context while building (not app functionality)
- Only you can access your connections
- Not included in your deployed app
- Managed in **Settings → Connectors → Personal connectors**

## Integrate any API

Lovable can integrate with **any external API**, public or private, authenticated or not. This is the most flexible integration type, allowing you to bring in functionality Lovable does not natively support.

When you ask Lovable to integrate an API, it automatically chooses the correct approach:

- **If the API requires no authentication**, your app calls the API directly.
- **If the API requires authentication**, Lovable prompts you to enable Cloud, add a secret, and automatically creates an Edge Function to protect sensitive credentials.

### APIs without authentication

If an API requires no credentials, there is no setup required. Just ask Lovable to integrate the API. For example:

```text wrap
Integrate Chuck Norris Jokes: https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random
```

Lovable detects that no key is required and adds the feature directly to your app.

### Authenticated APIs (requires secrets)

For APIs that require authentication credentials or API keys, Lovable handles the integration securely using Lovable Cloud. Credentials are stored as secrets in the linked Cloud project and accessed only through Edge Functions, ensuring they remain protected.

**Setup**

1. Ask Lovable to integrate the API  and include key details:
   - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
   - Authentication method (API key header, query param, Bearer token, OAuth)
   - Required headers (Content-Type, custom headers)
   - Request and response format examples (JSON, params, bodies)
   - OpenAPI spec or documentation link
2. Enable [Lovable Cloud](/features/cloud).
3. Add your API key under **Cloud → Secrets.**

**For example:**

```text wrap
Integrate the OpenWeatherMap API. 
Base URL: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5. 
Auth: API key passed as a query parameter appid. 
I need an endpoint to fetch the current weather: GET /weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={API_KEY}. 
Docs: https://openweathermap.org/current
```

Lovable generates the integration with an Edge Function and a weather widget where users can enter a city and fetch weather data.
