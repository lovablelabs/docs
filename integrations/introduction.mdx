Lovable integrates with a wide range of tools and platforms. There are three types of integrations, each serving a different purpose in how you build and run apps with Lovable.

## Lovable integrations overview

| **Category**   | **Purpose**                                                                                                         | **Example providers**                                        | **Used by**   |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Connector**  | Add capabilities to your published app                                                                              | Perplexity, Firecrawl, ElevenLabs, Stripe, Shopify, Supabase | Deployed app  |
| **MCP Server** | Provide context and content while building the app                                                                  | Miro, Linear, Notion, Atlassian, n8n                         | Lovable Agent |
| **Any API**    | Integrate any external API to add capabilities, which are not built-in or managed by Lovable, to your published app | Any custom or third-party API                                | Deployed app  |

## Connectors:  Add capabilities to your published app

Connectors let your Lovable apps call external services **after the app is deployed**.\
They function like plug-ins that give your app new abilities when the users interact with it.

Use Connectors when your deployed app needs to talk to another service or gain an operational capability.

### Examples

- **Perplexity** → research and answering questions
- **Firecrawl** → website scraping and crawling
- **ElevenLabs** → text-to-speech and audio generation
- **Stripe** → payments
- **Shopify** → ecommerce
- **Supabase** → authentication, database, storage

### Key characteristics

- Configured at the workspace level
- Reusable across all projects
- Provide functional capabilities your app can call while in use
- Managed in **Settings → Integrations → Connectors**

## **MCP servers:  Provide context while building**

MCP servers give the Lovable Agent access to content and artifacts inside the tools you already use, **during app creation**. They provide context so the agent can build apps that reflect your real workflows.

Use MCP Servers when your app should understand the documents, plans, or artifacts your team already has.

### **Examples**

- **Miro** → boards, diagrams, user journeys
- **Linear** → issues, specifications, roadmaps
- **Notion** → documentation and structured content
- **Atlassian** → Jira and Confluence pages
- **n8n** → automation workflows

### **Key characteristics**

- Used only during app generation and iteration
- Provide context, not operational application features
- Do not run inside the deployed app
- Managed in **Settings → Integrations → Your MCP Servers**

## Secrets: Integrate any API

Lovable can integrate with **any external API**, public or private, authenticated or not.

When you ask Lovable to integrate an API, it automatically chooses the correct approach:

- **If the API requires no authentication**, Lovable calls it directly from your app’s code.
- **If the API requires authentication**, Lovable prompts you to enable Cloud, add a secret, and automatically creates an Edge Function to protect sensitive credentials.

### APIs without authentication

Just ask Lovable to integrate the API. No setup needed. For example:

> Integrate Chuck Norris Jokes – [**<u>https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random</u>**](https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random)

Lovable detects that no credentials are required and adds the feature directly to your app.

### Authenticated APIs (requires secrets)

APIs requiring keys or tokens must call external services through Edge Functions so your credentials stay secure.

**Setup**

1. Ask Lovable to integrate the API . Include key details:
   - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
   - Authentication method (API key in header, query param, Bearer token, OAuth, etc.)
   - Required headers (Content-Type, custom headers, etc.)
   - Request and response format examples (JSON, params, bodies)
   - OpenAPI spec or documentation link
2. Enable [Lovable Cloud](/features/cloud).
3. Add your API key under **Cloud → Secrets.**

**For example:**

> Integrate the OpenWeatherMap API. \
> Base URL: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5. \
> Auth: API key passed as a query parameter `appid`. \
> I need an endpoint to fetch the current weather: `GET /weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={API_KEY}`. \
> Docs: https://openweathermap.org/current

Lovable generates the integration with an Edge Function and a simple weather widget where users can enter a city and fetch weather data.
