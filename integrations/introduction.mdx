Lovable integrates with a wide range of tools and platforms. There are three types of integrations, each serving a different purpose in how you build and run apps with Lovable.

## Lovable integrations overview

| **Category**          | **Purpose**                                                                                                   | **Example providers**                                        |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Connector**         | Add capabilities and external services that your deployed app can call                                        | Perplexity, Firecrawl, ElevenLabs, Stripe, Shopify, Supabase |
| **MCP Server**        | Provide context, documents, and artifacts to the Lovable Agent during app creation and refinement             | Miro, Linear, Notion, Atlassian, n8n, any custom MCP server  |
| **Any API (Secrets)** | Integrate custom or third-party APIs not built into Lovable when your deployed app needs custom functionality | Any API                                                      |

## Connectors:  Add capabilities to your published app

Connectors are the easiest way to extend the power of your Lovable app. They act like plug-ins that your app can call whenever it needs to perform an action or fetch data.

Connectors are ideal when your **deployed app** needs to interact with external services to gain operational capabilities.

### Examples and use cases

- **Perplexity**: asking questions or running research
- **Firecrawl**: scraping or crawling websites
- **ElevenLabs**: generating audio or speech
- [**Stripe**](/integrations/stripe): handling payments or subscriptions
- [**Shopify**](/integrations/shopify): managing ecommerce operations
- [**Supabase**](/integrations/supabase): authenticating users and storing data

  <Tip>
    When you need backend functionality, such as authentication, database, and storage, use [Lovable Cloud](/features/cloud), our built-in full-stack hosting platform.
  </Tip>

### Key characteristics

- Configured at the workspace level
- Reusable across all projects
- Provide functional capabilities your app can call while in use
- Managed in **Settings → Integrations → Connectors**

## **MCP servers:  Provide context during app creation**

[MCP servers](/integrations/mcp-servers) give the Lovable Agent access to content and artifacts inside the tools you already use, **during app creation**. They provide context so the agent can build apps that reflect your real workflows.

Use MCP Servers when your app should be created using the real content your organization already relies on.

### **Examples and use cases**

- **Miro:** using boards and diagrams to shape flows and UI
- **Linear:** importing issues and specs to generate features
- **Notion:** referencing docs and pages to guide app behavior
- **Atlassian (Jira and Confluence):** aligning with tickets, roadmaps, and documentation
- **n8n:** mirroring or plugging into existing automation workflows

### **Key characteristics**

- Used only while building the app
- Provide context, not app functionality
- Not included in your deployed app
- Managed in **Settings → Integrations → Your MCP Servers**

## Secrets: Integrate any API

Lovable can integrate with **any external API**, public or private, authenticated or not. This is the most flexible integration type, allowing you to bring in functionality Lovable does not natively support.

When you ask Lovable to integrate an API, it automatically chooses the correct approach:

- **If the API requires no authentication**, your app calls the API directly.
- **If the API requires authentication**, Lovable prompts you to enable Cloud, add a secret, and automatically creates an Edge Function to protect sensitive credentials.

### APIs without authentication

If an API requires no credentials, there is no setup required. Just ask Lovable to integrate the API. For example:

> Integrate Chuck Norris Jokes: [**<u>https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random</u>**](https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random)

Lovable detects that no key is required and adds the feature directly to your app.

### Authenticated APIs (requires secrets)

For APIs that use keys, tokens, or credentials, Lovable protects these secrets by generating an Edge Function.

**Setup**

1. Ask Lovable to integrate the API  and include key details:
   - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
   - Authentication method (API key header, query param, Bearer token, OAuth)
   - Required headers (Content-Type, custom headers)
   - Request and response format examples (JSON, params, bodies)
   - OpenAPI spec or documentation link
2. Enable [Lovable Cloud](/features/cloud).
3. Add your API key under **Cloud → Secrets.**

**For example:**

> Integrate the OpenWeatherMap API. \
> Base URL: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5. \
> Auth: API key passed as a query parameter `appid`. \
> I need an endpoint to fetch the current weather: `GET /weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={API_KEY}`. \
> Docs: https://openweathermap.org/current

Lovable generates the integration with an Edge Function and a weather widget where users can enter a city and fetch weather data.
