Lovable integrates with a wide range of tools and platforms. There are three types of integrations, each serving a different purpose in how you build and run apps with Lovable.

## Integrations overview

| **Category**   | **Purpose**                                                                                                          | **Example providers**                                                       | **Used by**   |
| :------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Connector**  | Power your app with different capabilities                                                                           | Perplexity, Firecrawl, ElevenLabs, Stripe, Shopify, Supabase, Lovable Cloud | Deployed app  |
| **MCP Server** | Provide context during build                                                                                         | Miro, Linear, Notion, Atlassian, n8n                                        | Lovable Agent |
| **Any API**    | Integrate any external API to power your app with different capabilities that are not built-in or managed by Lovable | Any custom or third-party API                                               | Deployed app  |

## Connectors:  Add capabilities to your published app

Connectors let your Lovable-built apps call external services at runtime. They act like plug-ins that give your published app new abilities.

### Examples

- **Perplexity** → research and answering questions
- **Firecrawl** → web scraping and site crawling
- **ElevenLabs** → text-to-speech and audio generation
- **Stripe** → payments
- **Shopify** → commerce
- **Supabase** → authentication, storage, and database APIs
- **Lovable Cloud** → full-stack app hosting (Lovable’s built-in backend platform)

### Key characteristics

- Configured at the **workspace** level
- Reusable across all projects
- Provide **runtime** API access or platform capabilities
- Managed in **Settings → Integrations → Connectors**

Use Connectors when your _deployed_ app needs to talk to another service or gain an operational capability.

## **MCP servers:  Provide context while building**

MCP servers give the Lovable Agent access to content and artifacts inside the tools you already use, **during app creation**, not at runtime. They provide context so the agent can build apps that reflect your real workflows.

### **Examples**

- **Miro** → boards, diagrams, user journeys
- **Linear** → issues and specifications
- **Notion** → documentation and structured content
- **Atlassian** → Jira and Confluence pages
- **n8n** → workflows

### **Key characteristics**

- Used only **during app generation and iteration**
- Provide **context**, not application features
- Do **not** run inside your deployed app
- Managed in **Settings → Integrations → MCP Servers**

Use MCP Servers when your app should understand the documents, plans, or artifacts your team already has.

## Secrets: Use any API

Lovable can integrate with **any API**, public or private, authenticated or not.

When you ask Lovable to integrate an API, it automatically decides how to handle it:

- **No authentication required** → Call it directly from the frontend
- **Authentication required** → Prompt you to enable Cloud, add a secret, and automatically generate an Edge Function

### APIs without authentication

Just ask Lovable to integrate the API. No setup needed. For example:

> Integrate Chuck Norris Jokes – [**<u>https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random</u>**](https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random)

Lovable detects that no credentials are required and adds the feature into your app directly.

### Authenticated APIs (requires secrets)

APIs with keys or tokens must run through Edge Functions so secrets stay secure.

**Setup**

1. Ask Lovable to integrate the API . Include key details:
   - Endpoint URLs and HTTP methods
   - Authentication method (API key in header, query param, Bearer token, OAuth, etc.)
   - Required headers (Content-Type, custom headers, etc.)
   - Request and response format examples (JSON, params, bodies)
   - OpenAPI spec or documentation link
2. Enable Lovable Cloud
3. Add your API key under Cloud → Secrets

**For example:**

> Integrate the OpenWeatherMap API. Base URL: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5. API key passed as a query parameter `appid`. I need an endpoint to fetch the current weather: `GET /weather?q={city}&units=metric&appid={API_KEY}`. See docs: https://openweathermap.org/current

Lovable generates the integration with an Edge Function and a simple weather widget where the user can enter a city and fetch weather data.
