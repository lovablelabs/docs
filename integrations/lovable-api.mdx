The **Lovable API** makes it possible to create and share Lovable apps programmatically — turning ideas, prompts, or even images into fully-generated applications with a single link.

It’s designed for developers, creators, and teams who want to **integrate Lovable into their workflows** or **automate app generation** from anywhere on the web.

## What is the Lovable API?

The Lovable API is a growing suite of features that extend what you can do with Lovable beyond the web interface.

The first release, [**Build with URL**](https://docs.lovable.dev/integrations/build-with-url), allows you to generate apps directly from a shareable URL.

With it, you can:

- Embed **Build with Lovable** buttons on your site or app.
- Share app-generating links with teammates or customers.
- Integrate Lovable app creation into internal tools or scripts.
- Prototype instantly from a single link.

## Why use the Lovable API?

- **Automation:** Trigger app creation from code, dashboards, or workflows.
- **Integration:** Bring Lovable into your own product experience.
- **Speed:** Generate and share new app ideas faster than ever.
- **Shareability:** URLs make collaboration simple and frictionless.
