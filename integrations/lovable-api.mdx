title: "Lovable API"

Imagine generating a complete Lovable app — not by typing a prompt into a form, but simply by clicking a link. That’s exactly what **Build with URL** makes possible.

With this new feature, you can create and share Lovable apps programmatically using simple, shareable URLs. Whether you’re building automation into your internal tools, embedding Lovable into your own website, or just sharing an idea with a teammate, **every app can start from a single link.**

## What you can do with Build with URL API

- **Embed “Build with Lovable” buttons**: Add one to your site or app. A single click launches Lovable and instantly builds your predefined app.
- **Share app ideas instantly**: Send ready-to-generate app links to friends, colleagues, or social media.
- **Automate workflows**: Integrate Lovable app creation into internal tools or scripts.
- **Prototype faster**: Use prompt-based URLs to spin up prototypes in seconds.

## How it works

Behind every **Build with URL** link is a prompt — your idea, encoded into a shareable link. Optionally, you can include image references to guide generation. Lovable takes care of the rest, automatically handling authentication and app creation for the user.
