Lovable makes it easy to integrate AI services into your web applications. Whether you want to build an AI-powered landing page, a text-generation tool, or a full SaaS app, Lovable's built-in integrations with services like 
[**OpenAI**](https://platform.openai.com/), [**Groq**](https://console.groq.com/keys), [**Claude**](https://www.anthropic.com/api), [**Deepseek**](https://api-docs.deepseek.com/), and [**Mistral**](https://docs.mistral.ai/api/) make it possible without writing backend code. Here's how to do it: 

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose the AI Feature You Need">
    Before you start building, define what you want the AI to do:

    - Generate or enhance text (e.g. email writer, tweet generator)
    - Classify or summarize content
    - Analyze images
    - Personalize responses
    - Integrate with a specific LLM API
  </Step>
  <Step title="Plan with Prompts First">
    Use Lovable's chat interface to describe your feature in simple terms. For example:

    ```
    Build an email enhancement tool. The user should write an email, then click buttons to make it more professional, concise, or friendly using Groq API.
    ```

    Lovable will scaffold the UI, suggest components, and let you preview the app quickly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Connect to a Backend with Supabase">
    AI features often need backend logic. Supabase provides:

    - Database for user data
    - Auth for login/signup
    - Edge Functions for calling external APIs securely

    <Tip>
      Set up Supabase early in your project to avoid UI/backend mismatches.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use Edge Functions for AI Calls">
    To safely call AI APIs, create an Edge Function inside Lovable:

    - Add your API key to the Supabase by submitting this via the secrets form
    - Let Lovable generate the edge function code
    - Ensure you use function calling if your API returns structured data (e.g. calories, macros, tweet threads)

    **Prompt Example:**

    ```
    Use GPT-4 and function calling to extract nutrition info from a meal description. Save the results to the backend.
    ```

    <Tip>
      Structure your OpenAI function calling schema with defined fields like:

      ```
      {
        "name": "extract_nutrition",
        "parameters": {
          "calories": "number",
          "protein": "number",
          "carbs": "number",
          "fat": "number"
        }
      }
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Make It Interactive">
    Add buttons or form actions for:

    - Submitting text to the AI
    - Uploading an image
    - Toggling between modes (concise vs friendly tone)

    Lovable lets you:

    - Attach functions to buttons
    - Animate interactions
    - Show real-time results with minimal prompting

    <Tip>
      Use screenshots and phrases like "make this smoother" to guide the design.
    </Tip>
    <Tip>
      **Advanced UX Tip:** Implement side-by-side live previews of the AI response. Use left/right layout blocks or tabs to let users compare outputs.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use External Services (Optional)">
    Some popular integrations for AI workflows:

    - **Resend** – send emails after form submission
    - **Groq API** – blazing fast LLM inference
    - **Stripe** – paywall access to AI tools
    - **Replicate** – generate or transform images

    **Prompt Example:**

    ```
    When a user submits the contact form, send an email using Resend and store the message in Supabase.
    ```

    <Tip>
      **Payments Tip:** Lock advanced AI features behind a Stripe subscription. Use conditional flows like:

      ```
      if (user.isPaid) { showAIFeature(); } else { redirectToCheckout(); }
      ```
    </Tip>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Test and Iterate">
    - Use preview links to test mobile responsiveness
    - Check performance with multiple API calls
    - Share your project for feedback
    - Use chat history to revert changes or refactor
  </Step>
  <Step title="Publish and Promote">
    When you're ready:

    - Deploy with a single click
    - Use [Lovable Launch](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/launched) to get visibility
    - Add OG tags and SEO title/description in the meta panel
    - Submit your app to Product Hunt, communities, and social media
  </Step>
</Steps>

## **Debug and Improve Prompts**

- Be specific with system messages: "You are a helpful nutritionist."
- Test function calling by mocking inputs.
- Use `console.log()` inside edge functions to trace logic.
- Use screenshots when asking Lovable to debug a layout.

**Prompt Tip:** If the AI fails to use your context (e.g. user's meals), say:

```
Make sure all of the user's meals are included in the prompt to GPT-4.
```

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Missing data in AI prompts?">
    Make sure you include context like user history or previous entries.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="UI not updating?">
    Use chat-only mode to debug one step at a time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Streaming issues with Groq/OpenAI?">
    Ensure `stream: true` is supported.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Image uploads not working?">
    Use file inputs and convert to base64 or upload via Supabase Storage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Edge Function fails silently?">
    View Edge Function logs in Lovable's function editor or Supabase dashboard.
  </Accordion>
