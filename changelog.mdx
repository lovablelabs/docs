<Update label="10/06/2025">

  **Lovable Cloud**  

        ![image](/images/lvbl-cloud-logo.png) 

Build full‑stack apps conversationally, with no manual Supabase setup. Lovable Cloud gives you on‑demand databases, user authentication, and storage that scales automatically as your app grows.

Lovable Cloud is available for all new projects, and any existing projects that aren’t integrated with Supabase. Learn more [here](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud). 

**Lovable AI** 

        ![image](/images/lvbl-ai-logo.png) 

You can now build AI-native apps in Lovable, just by prompting. We manage provider access & APIs so you can focus on building your product. Through October 13, we’re offering free embedded AI functionality in apps built on Lovable powered by our friends at Google Gemini. (Yes, that’s bananas!)


You can now build things like:
  - **Special-purpose ChatGPT clones** — tailored conversational assistants for support, sales, or knowledge work.  
  - **Avatar & image generators** — let users create, edit, and customize visual content.  
  - **Coaching apps** — personalized guidance, onboarding coaches, habit builders, and more.

Every plan includes free monthly credits to use towards embedded AI functionality in apps built on Lovable (yes, even free plans!) Full pricing and limits can be found [here](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/cloud#usage-based-cloud-and-ai-pricing).

**Voice Mode**

You can now talk to Lovable. We’re unlocking a more intuitive and conversational way of building: describe ideas and edits out loud and Lovable makes it.  

**Turn your files into apps** 

    ![image](https://lovable.dev/_next/image?url=%2Fcontent%2Fnews%2Fcovers%2Fiboxasset.png&w=1920&q=75)

Drop any file type into Lovable to turn it into an app. 

For example: 
  - Sheets →  interactive dashboards  
  - Resumes → portfolios  
  - Slide decks → custom presentations 

**Sonnet 4.5**   

Anthropic’s latest model now helps power your builds on Lovable. Expect stronger reasoning, more consistent results, and better performance on multi‑step edits and structured data.

**A smoother build experience**  

Building on Lovable just got smoother: quicker access to the Visual Editor, better long-run UX, and image support in the Code Editor.

**Confidently publish and unpublish** 

Ship with confidence. The publish flow now includes link‑preview editing before you go live. Made a mistake? Unpublish with one click.  

**Stripe integration** 

We’ve updated our Stripe integration with clearer billing & payment flows. Setup all your Stripe logic in chat by just describing what you want to build \- no manual setup required. 

**Updated community resources**  

Both our Partner page and Remix got upgrades so you can extend what you build through the community. Visit the partner page to find specialized agencies (or apply to be featured), and use Remix on your favorite Lovable Cloud projects to get started faster.

**Better workspace management**  

A new unified member view lets you understand usage and take actions across your team. Admins can now set session duration limits, turn on just-in-time provisioning (SSO), disable publishing and enforce project privacy settings. 

**Bug fixes**

  - Fixed in-chat sizing issues that caused horizontal scroll   
  - Reduced build errors by 20%

<Update label="09/01/2025">
  **Student + teacher discount live**

  We’re making it easier for students and educators to get building. Now, both students and teachers can save up to 50% off Pro, for up to a year. The discount applies if you’re starting from a free workspace—so you can unlock the full power of Lovable without stretching your budget. [Learn more about the offer here](https://lovable.dev/students).

  **Security upgrades**

  ![image](https://userimg-assets-eu.customeriomail.com/images/client-env-165734/1756734639962_security_01K42RPM40HYH5PH5QS40Z6FMY.png)

  Security is our priority. We’ve expanded our security features, policies, and certifications including adding SOC 2 Type 2 compliance and ISO 27001:2022 certifications. We also hired an incredible CISO, Igor Andriushchenko – so you can trust us with your ideas, your data, and your customers.
  Read more about our security features [here](https://lovable.dev/security).

  **Your new Lovable Inbox**

  ![image](https://userimg-assets-eu.customeriomail.com/images/client-env-165734/1756734786651_inbox_01K42RV3BXGH7MP6MYJ1KHKQH8.png)

  Your new personal inbox helps you track project and workspace invites, and you can also check out updates we’ve recently shipped—so you’re always up to speed.

  **Smarter SEO for new apps**
  When you create a new app or webpage, Lovable now includes agentic SEO instructions that better respect SEO best practices. This helps your projects get better indexed on search engines and reach the audiences you’re building for.

  **Workspace viewer role (Pro+)**
  For Pro+ members, we’ve introduced a new Viewer role. Viewers can see workspace metadata, projects, and members, but can’t create or edit projects or invite others. It’s the perfect role for stakeholders who need visibility, but don’t need to edit projects.

  **Flexible plan management**

  ![image](https://userimg-assets-eu.customeriomail.com/images/client-env-165734/1756734900964_Screenshot%202025-08-28%20at%205.05.18%20pm_01K42RYK0KYRNYETKVWAW22NFR.png)

  You can now upgrade or downgrade your plan in just a few clicks—whether you need more credits or want to scale down to free.

  **Clearer error feedback**

  ![image](https://userimg-assets-eu.customeriomail.com/images/client-env-165734/1756734470366_image%20\(4\)_01K42RHEPDYDCZT5NG96S3TEGY.png)

  If the LLM ever misinterprets your request, Lovable now lets you know directly. You’ll see what went wrong so you can adjust your prompt and move forward faster.

  **Track your edits + streaks**

  ![image](https://userimg-assets-eu.customeriomail.com/images/client-env-165734/1756734477303_GyzkRM5bEAAz-_N_01K42RHN8S62MTE2T7KC65JCB3.jpeg)

  We’ve added a personal dashboard where you can see how many edits you’ve made in Lovable and track your streaks. A great way to stay motivated and see your progress over time. Check it out under your Account Settings.
</Update>

<Update label="08/11/2025">
  **Agent Mode is the new default mode**

  With this upgrade, Lovable becomes a truly agentic partner—interpreting requests, understanding your codebase, fixing issues, executing complex multi-step edits across files, integrating with external tools, and reducing errors by 91%, so you can build more ambitious apps faster and with less friction.

  Legacy mode (where you don’t use agent) will be sunsetting on September 1, 2025..

  **Real-time analytics on your Lovable apps**

  Curious how your app is performing in the wild?
  You can now track live traffic and engagement directly inside Lovable including:

  - Visitors: How many people are using your app
    Pageviews: Which pages get the most attention
  - Visit duration: How long users stay
  - Bounce rate: What percentage leaves instantly
  - Views per visit: How deeply users engage

  The data updates in near real-time so you can spot trends, debug issues, or just celebrate your first users! Available now under Project Settings → Analytics

  **Pricing change coming to chat mode**

  Pricing for chat mode is moving from 1 credit per message to dynamic pricing, which matches the pricing model for agent mode. This means that each message and response cost is based on the complexity of the message; so some messages and responses cost less than 1 credit, and some, if quite complex, cost more. This change will be rolling out to all users on September 1, 2025.

  **Lovable business plan**

  Introducing the Lovable Business Plan, built for teams that need more control, privacy, and flexibility. It includes everything in Pro, plus powerful upgrades:

  - SSO for secure org-wide sign-in
  - Personal projects only visible to you
  - Templates for consistent styling
  - Yearly plans now available

  You can now switch to a yearly subscription for any paid Lovable plan. Get a discounted rate, simplify billing, and worry less about monthly renewals.

  **Visual edits v2**

  We have refined the visual edits experience after tons of feedback. More responsive, precise, and delightful to use. It’s faster than ever to tweak your UI, fix copy, or adjust layout—without leaving the live preview.

  You can also jump to selected elements in code when using visual edits, tightens the loop between design and implementation.

  **Project invites workflow**

  Invited users must now formally accept or decline access to a project—both from email and magic links. This avoids stale “pending” members and improves collaborator tracking.

  **Search all files in the code editor**

  Use the file search inside the code editor to quickly locate code and add file paths directly into chat.

  **Unified credits bar**

  We’ve shipped a new credits bar that combines all credit types into one clean, unified view—no more jumping between different displays to track usage.

  **Upgraded people tab**

  The People tab in workspace settings has been redesigned. It now includes pagination (20 users per page), search, and filtering by member status—making it much easier to manage large teams.

  **Scales to large workspaces**

  Thanks to backend improvements, we now support massive workspaces with tens of thousands of members without performance issues.

  **Published project badge**

  We’ve added a small but useful touch: all published projects now display a “Published” badge so it’s easier to see what’s live at a glance.

  **Bug fixes**

  - Fixed image upload bug causing \>1% of initial generations to fail if the user wasn’t logged in.
  - Prevents redundant updates when a project is already up to date with the deployed version.
  - You can now disconnect a project from legacy Supabase when disconnecting the org.
  - Reconnecting orgs with invalid tokens is now seamless.
</Update>

<Update label="04/25/2025" description="Lovable 2.0">
  We’re so excited to launch **Lovable 2.0**! This one’s all about collaboration, security, and giving you more control.

  ![Lovable Two Point Zero Pn](/images/lovable-two-point-zero.png)

  - We’ve rebranded! New logo, brighter colors, and a much cleaner UI. Go check it out below— we hope it feels like a glow-up.
  - [Teams](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/teams): Real-time collaboration is finally here! Invite others to co-edit apps or create shared team workspaces.
  - [**Simplified Pricing**](https://docs.lovable.dev/user-guides/messaging-limits#free-vs-paid-plans-comparison) with two clean options: Pro starts at \$25/month and Teams starts at \$30/month.
  - **Security Scan:** Lovable now checks for vulnerabilities when you publish (if you’re connected to Supabase). This is just the beginning of our work to make vibe coding safer by default.
  - When you try to revert to a past edit after which you ran a migration, Lovable will tell you we're not reverting the Database.
  - You asked, we listened. [Chat mode](https://docs.lovable.dev/features/modes#2-chat-mode) is now _way_ smarter and **here to stay** for everyone. It doesn’t make edits, but it _can_ help you reason through problems, plan features, inspect logs, query databases, and more. Think of it as your smart, hands-off pair programming buddy.

  This is a big step forward — and we're just getting started.

  Thanks so much for being on this journey with us
